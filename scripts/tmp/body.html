What emerges is a strangled, melodic hook offset by unsettling vocal effects and chords that spiral upwards in a nervous twist of energy.

The exhilarating track from her seventh studio album, <em>Beauty Marks</em>, follows the singer in the throes of infatuation, with a throwback disco beat that mimics her joy. The songâs straightforward production matches the force of her emotions; little more than a simple beat, bassline, and backing vocals elevate her voice.

On âGet Well Soon,â Taylor Vick, the Oakland-based folk-pop singer who has performed as Boy Scouts for nearly a decade, chooses instead to look at how breaking someoneâs heart can break yours, too. Singing over her lilting guitar, she makes it known that her decision is a compassionate act.

Backed by an orchestra that sounds plucked from Hollywoodâs Golden Age, she sings with compassion and grace to a lover she likens to a bird sheâs releasing from its cage. The contrast between the rhapsodic instrumentals and Korkejianâs stoic, heavy-lidded alto draws out the disparity between what is felt and what is said when lovers part ways.

The opening track of her second album, <em>At the Party With My Brown Friends</em>, it is Pacific Northwest indie rock at its finestâall quiet humming and watery guitar, mist and cold airâbut it retains the redemptive quality of gospel.

Atop a bed of 808s and bird calls, Thuggerâs yearning melodies set his Philadelphia counterpart up for a captivating (if all-too-brief) guest verse. âFlexinâ on these haters,â Uzi jeers, after rattling off all the designer labels on his person. âRicher than your first, richer than your last.â Success is the best revenge. âNoah Yoo</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L32ZHlOqqGY&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L32ZHlOqqGY" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Young Thug, âWhatâs the Moveâ [ft.

Itâs tempting to take the quartetâs audacity as a challengeâto pop sensibilities, to listener patienceâbut itâs more rewarding to embrace their constant sense of wonder. On âbmbmbmâ (pronounced âboom boom boomâ), they are puckish and aloof, stacking oblique lyrics and a warped sample of a wailing woman over a calm bass riff and steady drumming. The resulting mood is placid but tense, like a flame meandering down a fuse. Energetic bolts of noise and percussion materialize from the sky and vanish just as quickly, disrupting the groove but not toppling it. As the song continues, these disruptions become more frequent, building to a tempest of discord thatâs cathartic, indulgent, and kind of silly. But thatâs the thrill of black midi: Theyâre as unsure of where the muse will lead them as the listener is. âStephen Kearse</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/7dF151sPnAGBOC8RfjuKE1?si=qj1ja-LKQTitXxHC9otQmA&quot;}" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7dF151sPnAGBOC8RfjuKE1?si=qj1ja-LKQTitXxHC9otQmA" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">black midi, âbmbmbmâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pNonesuchp " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6b71d9669180008bb6461/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Vagabon-Flood.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6b71d9669180008bb6461/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Vagabon-Flood.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6b71d9669180008bb6461/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Vagabon-Flood.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6b71d9669180008bb6461/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Vagabon-Flood.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6b71d9669180008bb6461/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Vagabon-Flood.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6b71d9669180008bb6461/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Vagabon-Flood.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Nonesuch</p>

She described the process of creating for someone other than herself as âreliefâ from writerâs block, saying that there was freedom in that transference. The word âreliefâ implies a temporary state, a short break from a more permanent condition, but Tamkoâs statement can also be seen as an acknowledgement of what creativity in 2019 looks like: at its best when untethered from the exhaustive rituals of self-promotion. âFlood,â which served as the introduction to Vagabonâs self-titled second album, diverges from previous Tamko recordings, which were rooted in the singer-songwriterâs melancholy croon and guitar playing. On the chorus of âFlood,â in the shadow of a drum machine and synthesizers that rise tall like futuristic oaks, Tamkoâs voice embodies that modern-day creative isolation, taking on an almost robotic sheen. âAnupa Mistry</p></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-0"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body"><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De_e_TgsXjE&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De_e_TgsXjE" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vagabon, âFloodâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pDef Jamp " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6b948238c6f0008bc0d8d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/2-Chainz-NCAA.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6b948238c6f0008bc0d8d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/2-Chainz-NCAA.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6b948238c6f0008bc0d8d/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/2-Chainz-NCAA.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6b948238c6f0008bc0d8d/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/2-Chainz-NCAA.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6b948238c6f0008bc0d8d/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/2-Chainz-NCAA.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6b948238c6f0008bc0d8d/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/2-Chainz-NCAA.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Def Jam</p>

Released on the label of the powerful and enigmatic producer Don Jazzy, who also helped establish Afropop powerhouses like Tiwa Savage, Remaâs self-titled EP was composed of four tracks, each with a different soundâJuice WRLD-style trap, Young Thug-influenced melodies, and Afropop love ballads. But standing tall among them was âDumebi.â âDumebiâ feels both traditional and new.

His own music is a logical evolution of their writing, even more vulnerable and irrepressibly sad. âPop Outâ was his breakout, the track that introduced his sorrow-stricken voice to the masses. Although itâs set against a backdrop of actionâthe robbery in the chorus is detailed with the kinetic precision of a Brian De Palma filmâits real drama is internal, as Polo G processes the toll that playing the villain takes on your psyche. He may be the shooter, but in Polo Gâs world, everybodyâs a casualty.</p><p>Telling his story, Polo G makes every word matter. It takes a special talent to rhyme âpovertyâ with âanimosity,â and an even more special one to do it so casually that you donât even really notice.

These are songs that playfully skewer the fashion world for its vanity and vacuity while secretly desiring to be part of it. (Surely itâs no coincidence that all of the above also function as tailor-made catwalk soundtracks.) Chaiâs âFashionistaâ belongs in this tradition, though the Japanese pop maximalists are less focused on supermodels than on the cosmetics consumers buy in attempts to look more like them. The songâs punky disco bounce is less an invitation to pose for the paparazzi than the soundtrack to a daily drill of skincare routines and make-up applications. But lead singer Mana isnât about to accept her fate as a prisoner to the beauty industry: âSomeoneâs trend, itâs a shame!/Someoneâs rules, itâs a shame!â she shouts in Japanese, transforming âFashionistaâ from a lip-glossed pop jam into a revolutionary cry to stomp on your compacts in 4/4 time. âStuart Berman</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amwdDzK218A&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amwdDzK218A" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chai, âFashionistaâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pAtlanticp " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6ce8f4072b60008774468/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Burna-Boy-Anybody.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6ce8f4072b60008774468/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Burna-Boy-Anybody.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6ce8f4072b60008774468/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Burna-Boy-Anybody.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6ce8f4072b60008774468/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Burna-Boy-Anybody.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6ce8f4072b60008774468/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Burna-Boy-Anybody.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6ce8f4072b60008774468/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Burna-Boy-Anybody.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Atlantic</p>

Itâs a song about communion, an invocation of the very act of coming together, and an irresistible reminder of why we do. âPhilip Sherburne</p></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-0"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body"><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_wwmmo6UGY&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_wwmmo6UGY" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Peggy Gou, âStarry Nightâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pMom amp Popp " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6d3759669180008bb6465/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Neon-Indian-Toyota-Man.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6d3759669180008bb6465/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Neon-Indian-Toyota-Man.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6d3759669180008bb6465/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Neon-Indian-Toyota-Man.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6d3759669180008bb6465/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Neon-Indian-Toyota-Man.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6d3759669180008bb6465/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Neon-Indian-Toyota-Man.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6d3759669180008bb6465/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Neon-Indian-Toyota-Man.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Mom &amp; Pop</p>

Her words, spiked with equal parts apathy, opulence, and menace, echoed in Jamila Woodsâ mind as she worked on her second album, <em>LEGACY! LEGACY!</em>, a monument to black excellence. Like Hurston, the namesake of the albumâs first single, Woods is something of a polymath: a singer-songwriter, poet, teacher, and activist. But on âZORA,â she asserts that her selfhood is far more expansive than these labels, or any others thrust upon her, would suggest. âLittle boxes you canât stick unto me,â she sings, her vocals melting over a commanding backbeat. As if with a finger wag, she adds, âYou will never know everything.â But thereâs sweetness even in Woodsâ venom, as when she taunts her foes by threatening to âtenderly fill [them] with white light.â Itâs another nod to her multitudes: White light contains every color of the rainbow. âOlivia Horn</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO0_3XwBb5s&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO0_3XwBb5s" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jamila Woods, âZORAâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pColumbiap " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6d7469eef880008cd11cb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Caroline-Polachek-Door.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6d7469eef880008cd11cb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Caroline-Polachek-Door.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6d7469eef880008cd11cb/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Caroline-Polachek-Door.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6d7469eef880008cd11cb/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Caroline-Polachek-Door.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6d7469eef880008cd11cb/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Caroline-Polachek-Door.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6d7469eef880008cd11cb/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Caroline-Polachek-Door.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Columbia</p>

In <em>The Sun Still Burns Here</em>, a dance piece from Hadreas and Seattle-based dancer Kate Wallich, it becomes the totality: One preview described part of the performance as âessentially a fully clothed orgy,â for which Hadreas both composed the score and performs as a dancer. On âEye in the Wall,â the first song released from the project, he commands fragmented images of a body to become whole, âwild and free,â leaving him âfull of feelingâ¦full of nothing but love.â He issues these instructions in a louche warble, his twang and metallic shimmer gathering into a nine-minute reverie of Afro-Latin percussion and searing, silvery brightness that captures the incandescent feeling of physical abandon. âLaura Snapes</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oply9BPy6nU&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oply9BPy6nU" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Perfume Genius, âEye in the Wallâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pRepublicp " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6daef238c6f0008bc0d97/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Ariana-Grande-NASA.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6daef238c6f0008bc0d97/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Ariana-Grande-NASA.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6daef238c6f0008bc0d97/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Ariana-Grande-NASA.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6daef238c6f0008bc0d97/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Ariana-Grande-NASA.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6daef238c6f0008bc0d97/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Ariana-Grande-NASA.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6daef238c6f0008bc0d97/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Ariana-Grande-NASA.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Republic</p>

The directives are austere, but a slowed-down sample of the British electronic producer Lukidâs âTwisted Bloodâ infuses the song with life. âRICKYâ clanks and bounces, as if an airplane climbing toward higher altitudes has just hit turbulence. âCat Zhang</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WHm6tfvKlk&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WHm6tfvKlk" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Denzel Curry, âRICKYâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="The 100 Best Songs of 2019" class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6dc4c9eef880008cd11cf/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Pissy-Pamper.png" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6dc4c9eef880008cd11cf/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Pissy-Pamper.png 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6dc4c9eef880008cd11cf/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Pissy-Pamper.png 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6dc4c9eef880008cd11cf/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Pissy-Pamper.png 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6dc4c9eef880008cd11cf/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Pissy-Pamper.png 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6dc4c9eef880008cd11cf/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Pissy-Pamper.png 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div></figure></div><div role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3">43.</div><h2>Young Nudy / Playboi Carti: âPissy Pamperâ</h2><p>Even without an official release, âPissy Pamperâ was irrepressible.

Nudy proves a capable leading man, and few rappers sound more untroubled while detailing how they evade cops, but itâs his song in name only: Playboi Carti dominates with his spectacular, baby-voice verse. Only Carti is better at navigating Bourneâs circus beats than Nudyâtheyâve both had more practice than anyoneâbut here, they prove they work best as a team. Nudy is a perfect sidekick, Carti is a born star, and Bourne is the most daring rap producer working now.

Airy melodies seemed to drift out of her like breath. But her debut album, <em>Miss Universe</em>, challenges the idea that anyone should be so poised, and on the guitar-thrashing âIn Your Head,â she dazzlingly loses her shit.</p><p>While the verses move slow, with half-spoken lyrics shrugged into wide-open space, the choruses build like a panic attack, anguished and ferocious. The track is a perfect expression of a distinctly modern anxiety: being stranded in a place with no cell signal, dying to know whatâs going on in someone elseâs head. From the creeping intensity of the glimmering background synth to the perfectly imperfect way her voice skids when she hits the high notes, Yanya encapsulates the explosive tantrum feeling of not being able to reach <em>or</em> read someone, when in theory we should have their thoughts at our fingertips.

This new role of family man shaped his album <em>Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest</em> significantly. On the standout ballad â747,â Callahan contemplates the unspoiled gaze of a newborn baby, likening it to the view from an airplane.</p><p>While much of Callahanâs earlier catalog is tied to specific, isolated characters, â747â casts a wider glance, marveling at the splendor of birth and parental love. As he sits by the titular airplaneâs window, âflying through some stock footage of heaven,â he compares the celestial sight to an infantâs purity. âThis must be the light you saw/That just left you screaming,â he sings over sweetly plucked guitar. âAnd this must be the light you saw/Before our eyes could disguise true meaning.â He is certain that we lose this vision in time, each year getting further from that light. But, Callahan argues, we are doing the best we can. â747â is not a criticism of our transformation from wide-eyed infants to weary elders, but a tranquil acknowledgement of its inevitability. âMadison Bloom</p></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-0"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body"><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://billcallahan.bandcamp.com/track/747&quot;}" href="https://billcallahan.bandcamp.com/track/747" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bill Callahan, â747â</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pColumbiap " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e0d0238c6f0008bc0d9b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Bruce-Springsteen-Hello-Sunshine.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e0d0238c6f0008bc0d9b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Bruce-Springsteen-Hello-Sunshine.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e0d0238c6f0008bc0d9b/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Bruce-Springsteen-Hello-Sunshine.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e0d0238c6f0008bc0d9b/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Bruce-Springsteen-Hello-Sunshine.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e0d0238c6f0008bc0d9b/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Bruce-Springsteen-Hello-Sunshine.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e0d0238c6f0008bc0d9b/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Bruce-Springsteen-Hello-Sunshine.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Columbia</p>

As Four Tet describes it, he happened to hear the original song and began working on it almost as a lark, layering Furtadoâs vocals and locking them into sizzling hi-hats and knocking percussion. His rework quickly made its way from DJ to DJ (as these unofficial edits tend to do), appearing in sets by Peggy Gou, Ben UFO, and others, before finally being officially released this March.

In the frail centerpiece of the bandâs <em>Why Hasnât Everything Already Disappeared?</em>, he simply prods at the multiple ways humans give up, decay, and vanish. As a narrator, Cox expresses a kind of numb acceptance, and the scenery he offersâthe rotting houses and rusted enginesâare as bleak and beautiful as the songâs sweeping pianos and gentle guitar licks. Though âWhat Happens to People?â was recorded before the death of former Deerhunter bassist Josh Fauver late last year, the loss canât help but hang like a specter over this song about the inevitability of lifeâs end. âEvan Minsker</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1hmSATuFIvmaJN4OKfbAU0&quot;}" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1hmSATuFIvmaJN4OKfbAU0" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deerhunter, âWhat Happens to People?â</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pDirty HitInterscopep " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e2929eef880008cd11d4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/The-1975-People.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e2929eef880008cd11d4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/The-1975-People.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e2929eef880008cd11d4/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/The-1975-People.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e2929eef880008cd11d4/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/The-1975-People.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e2929eef880008cd11d4/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/The-1975-People.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e2929eef880008cd11d4/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/The-1975-People.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Dirty Hit/Interscope</p>

Healy wrote the lyrics while touring the American South earlier this year, around the time Alabama signed a draconian anti-abortion bill into law, and he shows the most desperate kind of gallows humor: âThe economyâs a goner, republicâs a banana, ignore it if you wanna.â The song is both a wake-up call and an admission of defeatâa balls-out strut to be played for the indifferent masses as the world burns. âRyan Dombal</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdPxXWm7Jg&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdPxXWm7Jg" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The 1975, âPeopleâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pSony UKp " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e2ee4072b60008774471/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Mark-Ronson-True-Blue.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e2ee4072b60008774471/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Mark-Ronson-True-Blue.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e2ee4072b60008774471/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Mark-Ronson-True-Blue.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e2ee4072b60008774471/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Mark-Ronson-True-Blue.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e2ee4072b60008774471/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Mark-Ronson-True-Blue.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de6e2ee4072b60008774471/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Mark-Ronson-True-Blue.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Sony UK</p>

Mark Ronsonâs most recent LP, <em>Late Night Feelings,</em> is full of sad dance tracks that mix glitter with broken glass, and none cut as deep as the Angel Olsen feature âTrue Blue.â Olsen sings like the final patron at a bar, crooning just loud enough to tell her sob story over the blaring jukebox. Itâs unclear if anyoneâs listening, but that makes it all the more tragic. The funky bass riff and disco drums mock her distress, setting the scene for a dance where our heroine has no partner: âI ran to you and you know why,â she shouts at the empty barstool next to her. âTrue Blueâ is the sound of taking your heartache out for a night on the townâyou might be able to sedate it with booze and loud music, but you will wake up in its arms the next morning. âMadison Bloom</p></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-0"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body"><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuJ2yitJI_U&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuJ2yitJI_U" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mark Ronson, âTrue Blueâ [ft.

Riding a steady current of crisply picked acoustic guitar and rippling piano, the song is crammed with references to ferrets and eggs, doves and nuts, peaches freshly harvested and hands reaching out of barrels. The imagery is familiar, yet the New Zealand-born/Wales-based artist deploys it in a way that makes these everyday objects sound off-kilter and foreign, like signs held askew to point in a direction few have traveled. She arranges the songâa standout on her third album, the folk-pop gem <em>Designer</em>âso it builds gradually, adding new elements that subtly reshape its flow.

With a keening croak and hearty 12-string, Adrianne Lenker traverses this liminal space in great strides, implicating beauty, fear, plant life, and human death in a vast spiritual conspiracy.

Sometimes the song is sublimely funky; sometimes it feels designed to make your stomach gurgle. Until three minutes in, itâs a wiggly little thing, its cha-cha beat working double-time as frontman Ezra Koenig coos like a sexy villain. But when the drums kick in for the final 45 seconds, they introduce an explosive wall of sound thatâs as urgent as an air raid siren.

Mercifully, Rico Nasty returned with her dynamic brand of catharsis, smashing through walls like a pint-sized Kool-Aid Man. <em>Anger Management</em>, her collaborative project with the producer Kenny Beats, was released just as spring arrived, but by summer, Rico seemed to have gotten fight music out of her system. In July, she dropped âTime Flies,â a Dee B-produced loosie that appears on the <em>Madden NFL 20</em> soundtrack. Ironically, the song sounds more like the brief, intoxicating respite that comes after scream therapy than the dyspeptic fury youâd expect of anything associated with the NFL. Sparkly, melodic, and ultimately optimistic, âTime Fliesâ recalls the treacly, animated energy of Ricoâs early days. As the beat bubbles and then strikes, she catalogs her pain; there is loss, fear, undeserved hate. But even as the reasons for Ricoâs anger persist, her own attitude helps spur transformation: âGot tired of complaining/I got up and changed my situation,â she sings. As summer turned into fall, that sentiment proved just as useful as her anger has been. âRawiya Kameir</p></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-0"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body"><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIYgNhz2ty8&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIYgNhz2ty8" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rico Nasty, âTime Fliesâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pMexican Summerp " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7ce209669180008bb6517/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Cate-Le-Bon-Daylight-Matters.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7ce209669180008bb6517/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Cate-Le-Bon-Daylight-Matters.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7ce209669180008bb6517/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Cate-Le-Bon-Daylight-Matters.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7ce209669180008bb6517/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Cate-Le-Bon-Daylight-Matters.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7ce209669180008bb6517/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Cate-Le-Bon-Daylight-Matters.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7ce209669180008bb6517/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Cate-Le-Bon-Daylight-Matters.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Mexican Summer</p>

The melancholy is a reflection of Le Bonâs environment: She composed <em>Reward</em> in the near-solitude of Englandâs mountainous Lake District. Cloaked in dreamy synths and rounded saxophone, âDaylight Mattersâ hints at glam rockâs bravado while retaining Le Bonâs characteristic playfulness.

The song itself is all sweeping Laurel Canyon haze: a hook thatâs almost entirely pedal steel guitar and a sad, swooning vocal delivery that seems coated in FM static. While her music has felt increasingly connected to classic rock radio, this songâwith its analog hum and open road grandeurâsignaled a deeper inquiry into whatâs so <em>classic</em> about those old standbys. The video, however, looked more like a Y2K-era screensaver on a desktop computer: a steady, slightly pixelated flow of distant stars in an endless black sky. This melding of our recent and distant pasts is crucial to Meringâs songwriting; she moves forward by studying where weâve been, rendering it both familiar and somewhat uncanny. âSam Sodomsky</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StSEXZcwOB4&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StSEXZcwOB4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Weyes Blood, âAndromedaâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pJagjaguwarp " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7d78eb9e6f50008a30626/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Bon-Iver-Hey-Ma.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7d78eb9e6f50008a30626/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Bon-Iver-Hey-Ma.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7d78eb9e6f50008a30626/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Bon-Iver-Hey-Ma.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7d78eb9e6f50008a30626/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Bon-Iver-Hey-Ma.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7d78eb9e6f50008a30626/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Bon-Iver-Hey-Ma.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7d78eb9e6f50008a30626/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Bon-Iver-Hey-Ma.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Jagjaguwar</p>

Itâs a powerful moment: one of the most influential musicians of the 21st century stripping everything away so he can sing directly to you. The words might sound unsettled and unspecificâsomething about waiting outside, going into a room, learning the truthâbut heâs always made a virtue out of impressionistic lyrics. This is a song less about communication than connection: Who keeps you grounded? Who pulls you out of the coal mine and into the real world?

Again and again, she ventures into dank places and emerges with observations that are striking for their lucid originality and humor. On âAshes to Ashes,â she tills the sediments of sex, art, and mortality, dragging ash from a cigarette into a grave and equating penetrating fingers to the double-digit swipe of a phone screen to a frantic drowning kick. The song takes place in a dream and preserves dream logic, psychologically cogent yet somehow logically inexplicable.

On âAll Mirrors,â the title track of her latest album, Olsen introduced her latest (and perhaps greatest) incarnation: mighty goth sorceress. The song unfurls like the train of a black satin wedding gown, undulating on a bed of sinister, classic-Hollywood strings and subtle synth pulses. Olsen intones ominously about lost beauty, being buried alive, and repeating the past, building to the kind of cathartic climax that demands to be shouted from a windswept cliff in a fierce rainstorm (preferably while wearing the elaborate bejeweled headpiece from the songâs striking <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjt698Zv5jQ&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjt698Zv5jQ" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">music video</a>).

After a mixtapeâs worth of unfinished music was leaked in 2013, Paul basically disappeared for the next six years, establishing himself as a reclusive mad genius. But in June of this year, Paul <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/jai-paul-returns-with-2-new-songs-listen/">re-emerged</a>, releasing an official version of the leak and two new songs: âHeâ and âDo You Love Her Now.â âHeâ begins with fast strokes like âBootyliciousâ before Paulâs signature funky guitar and pillowy whole notes emerge. The track carries the Prince allusions often ascribed to Paulâclanging synths only enhance the â80s flavorâbut thereâs a new earnestness to the song that becomes apparent toward the bridge. Paulâs voice breaks away from all affect, and it sounds as though weâre hearing him sing into the booth through the talkback button in a studioâs control room, unadorned and unmicâd. It sounds like heâs finally free. âAnupa Mistry</p></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-0"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body"><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5DSbyl7WYs&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5DSbyl7WYs" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jai Paul, âHeâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pColumbiap " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dee8b6bcade48000818ed81/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Nas-X.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dee8b6bcade48000818ed81/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Nas-X.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dee8b6bcade48000818ed81/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Nas-X.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dee8b6bcade48000818ed81/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Nas-X.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dee8b6bcade48000818ed81/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Nas-X.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dee8b6bcade48000818ed81/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Nas-X.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Columbia</p>

Megan Thee Stallion and DaBabyâboth witty Southerners with distinct if borderline-conventional rap stylesâseize the Lil Ju beat as a stage. The production booms and yet is barely there, and actually elevates their vocals. The pair delivers some of the yearâs most-recited lyrics: Meganâs capitalist-feminism (âYeah Iâm in my bag but Iâm in his tooâ) was inescapable, both as a club staple and as a trending social media philosophy. DaBaby, as 2019âs reigning steal-your-girl lothario, made for plenty of Instagram captions, too. But even in its ubiquity, âCash Shitâ didnât get oldâarguably, in part, because Megan and DaBaby both rap about sex like they have plenty of it, a transcendent feat among their peers whoâve been clouded in a low-libido haze. Two much-hyped music videos were subsequently abandoned, making it quite clear: The song itself is plenty. âRawiya Kameir</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xe7OAFljOA&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xe7OAFljOA" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Megan Thee Stallion, âCash Shitâ [ft.

Its bassline is a lure, the hi-hat a metronome for your sacrum to ride.

Its volume drops abruptly, pulling the listener in close, making them strain to catch the breath braided so exquisitely by Billie Eilish and her co-producer/brother, Finneas OâConnell. A pop miniaturist who shuns grand vocal acrobatics, she skirts the edge of inaudible to invent a new kind of subdued sass. Her virtuosity is in tone and texture: the delicious derision of âduh,â the way she smudges consonants and crumbles vowels in her mouth. Apart from the occasional deliberately unsubtle effect, like the juddering digital croak on the chorus, itâs an artfully crafted illusion of intimacy.</p><p>âbad guyâ is a crawlspace of a track that feels like itâs made of the same whispery fabric as Eilishâs voice: clicks, whirrs, fingersnaps, and ear-tickling sounds that prompt ASMR tingles. Furtive and nimble, the beat moves just like her lines about âcreeping around like no one knows,â yet the bass, when it hits, has the dancefloor heft of trap. As for Eilishâs jaded goth-pop schtick? Those who can only remember being teenage may smile at lines like âMy soul? So cynical.â But for the actual teens whoâve followed her rise to the top of the charts, Eilish captures the tender mess of being young and alive. âSimon Reynolds</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Billie Eilish, âbad guyâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="p4ADp " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7df284072b600087744e9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Big-Thief-Not.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7df284072b600087744e9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Big-Thief-Not.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7df284072b600087744e9/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Big-Thief-Not.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7df284072b600087744e9/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Big-Thief-Not.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7df284072b600087744e9/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Big-Thief-Not.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7df284072b600087744e9/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Big-Thief-Not.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>4AD</p>

Its title, which refers to the birdsong that accompanies sunrise, could represent resolution, or perhaps the bittersweet end of a glorious night. Maybe itâs just a âbloody racket,â as Yorke mutters, riffing on how one manâs symphony is anotherâs dirge.

Let Sharon Van Etten be the new author of your 17th year: She knows its allure and innocence, how it feels to be on the cusp of adulthood. She knows the paradox of being a teen is that itâs all over soon, but it will stay with you forever. âSeventeen,â her anthem from <em>Remind Me Tomorrow,</em> is the climax of her journey from quiet cafÃ© folk singer to venerable rock star. It rolls like a boulder down a mile-long hill, pushed by a synth-rock snare and a seething, roaming performance from Van Etten as she feels every single word. When she performs the song live, she strafes around the stage, microphone in hand, like sheâs searching the crowd for someone, until she finally finds her younger self among them and delivers the coup de grÃ¢ce: âAfraid that youâll be just like me.â How she invokes time, self, youth, guilt, and forgiveness with just one line reveals the masterful craft of Van Etten on one of her greatest songs yet.  âJeremy D.

Luckily, with âCaro,â urbano shapeshifter Bad Bunny offers a more practical solution to embracing your worth. The song rescues ideas of empowerment from sponsored hashtag hell, with the Puerto Rican star flicking off critics of his androgynous style and class-collapsing brashness over a trap beat thatâs as quietly menacing as an alien hovercraft. âDonât you see that Iâm expensive?â he spits in Spanish, voicing the indignance of anyone whoâs been made to feel undeserving because of what they wear or who they love. Then, midway, the sinister instrumental evaporates, and Bad Bunny is joined by none other than Ricky Martinâwho was once lambasted by Puerto Rican clergy members after he came out as gayâfor a cloud-parting bridge that exposes the songâs pristine core: âWhy canât I just be?â they plead. âWhat harm is it to you? Iâm just happy.â Itâs a startlingly vulnerable moment, one that makes this anthem of acceptance that much more invincible. âRyan Dombal</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg64AFnRnkc&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg64AFnRnkc" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bad Bunny, âCaroâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pAtlanticp " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e242b9e6f50008a30631/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Charli-XCX-Gone.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e242b9e6f50008a30631/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Charli-XCX-Gone.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e242b9e6f50008a30631/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Charli-XCX-Gone.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e242b9e6f50008a30631/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Charli-XCX-Gone.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e242b9e6f50008a30631/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Charli-XCX-Gone.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e242b9e6f50008a30631/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Charli-XCX-Gone.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Atlantic</p>

The songâs central tension is nothing newâbeing surrounded by people yet feeling so aloneâbut how she chooses to alleviate that pain is something special: with a bombastic, bulletproof synth-pop chorus that revels in the roiling chaos of social anxiety. Christine and the Queensâ HÃ©loÃ¯se Letissier is Charliâs perfect foil, adding her own cryptic ruminations on self-isolation over spiky synth stabs and glittering, glitched-out effects.

On âBags,â the lead single from her debut album, <em>Immunity</em>, the Gen Z pop songwriter sings with the kind of bittersweetness that could either herald the beginning of a new romance or signal its smoldering end. The image she paints repeatedly in the chorusââwalking out the door with your bagsââhangs frozen like a still from a movie, melancholic and unabating. Behind her, though, a synthesizer chirps like a second, excitable singer. Itâs as if Clairo is envisioning a breakup at the very moment of the first kiss, the sparks and the sadness translucent and overlaid on top of each other. How do you savor intimacy when you can foresee its failure in vivid detail? âBagsâ outlines the fight to stay present in the good stuff, even when your brain is fast-forwarding to the collapse. âSasha Geffen</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9HYJbe9Y18&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9HYJbe9Y18" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clairo, âBagsâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pPolydorInterscopep " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e2b8b517ce000899efb6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Lana-Del-Rey-The-Greatest.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e2b8b517ce000899efb6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Lana-Del-Rey-The-Greatest.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e2b8b517ce000899efb6/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Lana-Del-Rey-The-Greatest.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e2b8b517ce000899efb6/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Lana-Del-Rey-The-Greatest.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e2b8b517ce000899efb6/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Lana-Del-Rey-The-Greatest.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e2b8b517ce000899efb6/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Lana-Del-Rey-The-Greatest.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Polydor/Interscope</p>

Civilization teeters toward oblivion, the temperature climbs upward, and Lana Del Rey is our soothsayer. She narrates these end times with a wry resignation thatâs nostalgic and tactile, dreamy yet prickly. Pining for Long Beach and a lost lover, missing the music and nightlife of New York, her response to the future is to cling to her past. Sheâs had a ball, but as she flips through the photo album, she concedes that the culture is a little too lit, that the heat is making her breath feel heavy.</p><p>The gut punch of the song is that despite her exhaustion, she sounds fulfilled. There&#x27;s contentment in her voice as it floats over Jack Antonoff&#x27;s sour guitar chords and soft keys, as if sheâs savoring her just desserts. This isnât just a character study, though: As one woman&#x27;s world goes up in smoke, Del Rey zooms out to observe other anguishes: Kanye West is a shadow of himself; Hawaii is panicked by fictional missile strikes; David Bowieâs vision of life on Mars is now being pursued by Elon Musk. As her voice drops to a whisper, she takes in this surreal and depressing panoramaâ<em>what a truly ludicrous ending, right?</em>âthen suddenly she perks up. Why? Because thereâs a livestream to watch. The greatest loss of all, it turns out, is our attention spans. âStephen Kearse</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndo8r_Hg_lg&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndo8r_Hg_lg" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lana Del Rey, âThe Greatestâ</a></p><hr/><div class="callout callout--inset-left callout--has-top-border callout--content-type--asset-embed"><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="pYoung Turksp " class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e2f9b517ce000899efb8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/FKA-twigs-Cellophane.jpg" srcSet="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e2f9b517ce000899efb8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/FKA-twigs-Cellophane.jpg 1600w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e2f9b517ce000899efb8/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/FKA-twigs-Cellophane.jpg 1280w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e2f9b517ce000899efb8/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/FKA-twigs-Cellophane.jpg 1024w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e2f9b517ce000899efb8/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/FKA-twigs-Cellophane.jpg 768w, https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5de7e2f9b517ce000899efb8/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/FKA-twigs-Cellophane.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__text"><p>Young Turks</p>

Projecting strength in moments of extreme fragility feels like itâs become part of her routine more recently; a very public breakup with her Hollywood ex was followed by the discovery of a medical condition anchored in her uterus. This yearâs <em>MAGDALENE</em> was twigsâ exorcism of those woesâthe ones that suddenly appear on your doorstep, the ones brewing internallyâwith âcellophaneâ as its final absolution.</p><p>Heartbreak is a trial so delicate that the slightest degree of pressure can shift whether it ends in acceptance or despair. On âcellophane,â twigs recognizes that fissure and puts on an acrobatic display of deciding whether sheâll dip a toe into the darkness of its void. Itâs a song best listened to alone, where the beauty of its restraint can be made clear. A whisper of a beat propels an inquisition into self-doubt, longing, and regretâher voice aches, soaring with resolve before a gravitational pull brings it back down. A dreamy piano melody serves as a sidekick alongside synths that swell to a climax and then drop out altogether. It masterfully makes the ugly, complicated mess of interrogating lost love feel like an act of pride. Because when youâve aimed a spotlight at yourself, perhaps all that matters is knowing youâre worthy of its glow. âPuja Patel</p><p><strong>Listen:</strong> <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84&quot;}" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FKA twigs, âcellophaneâ</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></article><div class="content-footer"><div class="row"><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-0"></div></div><div class="content-bottom-anchor"></div><div class="consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-footer consumer-marketing-unit--no-failsafe"><div class="consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-footer"></div></div><div class="isServer-fallback"><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="" class="recirc-list-wrapper hide-read-more-ad viewport-monitor-anchor"><div class="row recirc-list-observer-target content-footer__related"><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-0 summary-collection-grid recirc-list__items recirc-list--four-up summary-collection-grid--four-columns"><div class="grid--item summary-collection-grid__content"><div class="section-title section-title--center summary-collection-grid__title section-title--line-above-below"><div class="section-title__hed">Read More</div></div><div class="summary-collection-grid__items hide-read-more-ad"><div tabindex="0" class="summary-item summary-item--has-border summary-item--has-rule summary-item--article summary-item--no-icon summary-item--text-align-left summary-item--layout-placement-text-below summary-item--layout-position-image-left summary-item--layout-proportions-50-50 summary-collection-grid__item" role="button"><a class="summary-item__image-link summary-item-tracking__image-link" href="/features/lists-and-guides/best-albums-2019" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" data-component-type="recirc-river" data-recirc-id="item-image-1" data-recirc-pattern="summary-item"><span class="responsive-asset photo-1x1-275x137 summary-item__image responsive-asset--invisible"><style>

The album is a wonderful scenario for an artist a decade into their career: a rewarding balance of consistency and growth, with subtle experimentation instead of the common midcareer misstep of transparently grabbing for radio play. Brown knows what works and honors it here.\n\nNotably, *uknowhatimsayinÂ¿* is executive produced by Q-Tip, whose penchant for air and texture encourages Brown into a mellower, more sober headspace. Fuzzy guitar, looped strings, and expansive guest spots from fellow vets Blood Orange and Run the Jewels underscore a new phase of Brownâs work without blotting out the high-pitched urgency that made him a compelling figure in the first place. That heâs still rapping his ass off makes *uknowhatimsayinÂ¿* as satisfying to hear as you can imagine it was for Brown to make. âRawiya Kameir\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fdanny-brown\u002Fuknowhatimsayin){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F2DPWHFX){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002F92734f59){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de6851ab9e6f50008a304dc]|||\nOstgut Ton|||\n\n+++\n\n### 47.\n## Barker: *Utility*\n\n\nSam Barker is wary of taking the easy route in getting people to move their bodies. A resident DJ at Berlinâs hallowed techno haven Berghain, he has voiced his skepticism of kick drums and dropsâthe utilitarian elements that so often trigger lizard-brain reactions on a dancefloor. For his debut album, *Utility*, Barker dug into his archives to see which of his old sketches sounded good when he stripped them back to the studs. The result is mysterious, weightless. These tracks still throb: âHedonic Treadmillâ and âUtilityâ are trance-like bangers made propulsive entirely via cycling synth melodies, and even the more ambient songs swell and build like club music.

Even the side-long closing track, âAwakening From the Dream of Existence to the Multidimensional Nature of Our Reality (Mirror of the Soul),â seems like a nod to the â70s prog acts whose dark visions helped inspire countless subgenres of heavy music. Yet the real brilliance of this music lies in how *free* it sounds from whatâs come before. On these four songsâranging from gnarled chaos in âThe Giza Power Plantâ to the psychedelic slow burn of âInner Paths (to Outer Space)ââBlood Incantation find their own corner in a storied cosmos, where even the most familiar textures can feel thrilling and extreme. âSam Sodomsky\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fblood-incantation\u002Fhidden-history-of-the-human-race){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F2DLNsXs){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002F4f529eff){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7dfcbb517ce000899efb1]|||\nXL|||\n\n+++\n\n### 40.\n## Thom Yorke: *ANIMA*\n\n\nWas 2019 the year Thom Yorke finally got funky?

But what happens when that hope is suddenly dashed? Nick Cave confronts this reality on *Ghosteen*, the first album he wrote and recorded in full after the tragic accidental death of his teen son, Arthur. Itâs a record unlike anything else heâs made with the Bad Seeds across the last 35 years.\n\nOn \"Hollywood,\" the double LP's 14-minute closing track, Cave viscerally summarizes his broken heart. \"The kid drops his bucket and spade\u002FAnd climbs into the sun,\" he murmurs before the trackâs steady bassline suddenly glitches, as if the needle of a turntable has hit a bad groove, and Cave begins to keen in falsetto. *Ghosteen* abounds with stark moments like this that reveal the raw heart of grief. To sit with it can be almost unbearable, and yet Caveâwith the same talent heâs loaned to many other dark topicsâtakes the harshness of life and uses it to cleave his way to the truth of being human. Singing his sorrow so nakedly, with so little reserve, Cave asks the world to bear witness to the love heâs shared and his cavernous, neverending loss. âSasha Geffen\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fnick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds\u002Fghosteen){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F3682aUU){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002F632987f0){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7ed6cb517ce000899eff8]|||\nDouble Double Whammy|||\n\n+++\n\n### 27.\n## Florist: *Emily Alone*\n\n\n*Emily Alone* is the kind of delicate album that doesnât compete for your attention so much as it waits patiently for you to return to it. Credited to singer-songwriter Emily Spragueâs band but very much a solitary project, the record comes on the heels of a few years in which she underwent three of the biggest changes a person can undergo: the dissolution of a relationship, the death of a parent, and a major shift in location, from upstate New York to California. Not that the trauma surfaces in the music. If anything, *Emily Alone* embodies the hard-earned truth that behind every moment, however dramatic, lies another, quieter moment, transpiring without expectation or pressure.\n \nLike the water Sprague often sings about, and by which she is so evidently moved, the music here is rippling and continuous, bedroom folk rendered with the meditative heart of new age. (That she also makes [beautiful, droning synthesizer music](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Freviews\u002Falbums\u002Femily-a-sprague-water-memory-mount-vision\u002F) isnât surprising.) The albumâs underlying note is a kind of supreme confidence, the sound of an artist seeking truth with open eyes, a gentle heart, and a practiced commitment to the possibility that under the politics and advertising lies a beautiful experience of the world. And so she puts her faith in trees, the ocean, her friends, and, finally, herself. *Emily Alone* dares you to tell her sheâs wrong. âMike Powell\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fflorist\u002Femily-alone){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F2DNLt4R){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002Fe533f29){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7ed974072b600087744ef]|||\nAtlantic|||\n\n+++\n\n### 26.\n## Burna Boy: *African Giant*\n\n\nNigeriaâs Burna Boy titled his fourth album *African Giant* to reflect his own outsized stature in his home country and, more broadly, the continentâs eons-long cultural footprint. On it, he perfects styles from the worldwide African diaspora and situates them in universal conversation, while his sharp ear for collaboratorsâincluding Future and YG, Lagos rapper Zlatan, Kingston crooner Serani, and Beninise icon AngÃ©lique Kidjoâunderpins his thesis and shows off his range.\n\nThe record is a sublime peak for the interchange between pared-down Afrobeats and sax-infused dancehall, and Burna Boyâs supple, occasionally craggy vocalsâin English, Igbo, Pidgin, Yorubaâdeliver intimacy, romance, and politically biting messages about colonialism. *African Giant* places him in the lineage of his Nigerian countryman Fela Kuti, a national treasure whose supreme musicality was inextricable from the rebellious surroundings in which it was made. More than his ability to smoothly navigate and naturally fuse genres through his voice, Burna Boyâs opus reflects a rare magnanimity of vision that is also simply irrefutable on a dancefloor. âJulianne Escobedo Shepherd\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F2Lt0k93){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002F9bc1692f){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de6e3c29eef880008cd11d6]|||\nColumbia|||\n\n+++\n\n### 25.\n## Vampire Weekend: *Father of the Bride*\n\n\nVampire Weekend ambled away from the spotlight for a half-decade or so, but even as the delays mounted for the follow-up to their 2013 masterpiece *Modern Vampires of the City*âand even as Rostam Batmanglij, long thought to be their behind-the-scenes mastermind, left to pursue other projectsâthey returned on *Father of the Bride* as if theyâd just stepped out of the country club for a breath of sea air.

Norwegian art-pop philosopher Jenny Hval floats between these logical dots throughout *The Practice of Love*, an album of festering generational unease set to the twilit synths and entrancing pulses of â90s raves. The music is a wryly nostalgic nod to the moment in history just before we as a species fully understood how quickly life on Earth as we know it might collapse.\n\nSurveying a wounded forest, Hval finds spirits stronger than God: herself, her friends, the continuums of art and ecology. She reckons with being child-free in a society that constantly reminds her how sheâs running out of biological time. And, finally, she finds liberation in feeling equivalent to an annual plant, blooming once briefly and then fading into the forest. *The Practice of Love* asks more questions than it answers: Are we more responsible to ourselves or to our species? What value is conforming in a world where norms have ruined us? And what does oneâs legacy look like when the future isnât guaranteed? These are what Hval calls her âloops of the mind,â scattered here among voices that search for communion in an atmosphere of crisis. âGrayson Haver Currin\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fjenny-hval\u002Fthe-practice-of-love){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F367wYVy){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002F4a0b0402){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5dee7af429131e0008fba759]|||\nMexican Summer|||\n\n+++\n\n### 19.\n## Jessica Pratt: *Quiet Signs*\n\n\nJessica Prattâs folk songs usually press right up against the speaker, making you feel inches away from her delicately voiced guitar, lonesome words, and peculiar execution of vowelsâa language unto itself.

Even on the twinkling âImpossible,â where she evokes how weird and cool it is to be a young person with a messy, meaningful life ahead, she never hides. Cottrill, who went viral in 2017 with the charmingly homemade track âPretty Girl,â has said that *Immunity* is partly about the process of coming out as bisexual, and songs like âBagsâ and âWhite Flagâ feel undeniably about the beginnings of things. Meanwhile, the closing âI Wouldnât Ask You,â about Cottrillâs struggle with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, is born directly from fresh pain: A choir of children lifts the song up, and youâre reminded how, in early adulthood, you wonder if youâre ever going to figure life out.

You can see its vision of egalitarianism across the LPâs inner gatefold, which shows obscured portraits of the 52 people who helped create the record. You can hear its selflessness in the myriad tones, instruments, voices, and happy accidents that come and go, subverting ego while sidestepping excess. Even the title *i,i* nods to the Rastafarian idea of âI and I,â of oneness. Of course, Justin Vernonâs elastic howl will always be the catalyst that transforms Bon Iver from just another experimental indie rock project to a quasi-religious cult of emotion, but on *i,i*, he sounds like heâs simply flowing through a slipstream, his load lightened.\n\nThe songs follow an elusiveâand affectingâdream logic. With its queasy synths, snatches of stray trumpet, and gas mask imagery, âJelmoreâ conjures a landscape from a not-too-distant future thatâs been left desolate by climate change. âShâdiahââwhich Vernon began writing the morning after the 2016 election, with a title that stands for âshittiest day in American historyââfights the ugliness of modern politics with an understated call for rationality. âU (Man Like)â is a piano ballad that urges men to do better. âPower has come to me,â Vernon [said](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Ffeatures\u002Fcover-story\u002Fbon-iver-interview\u002F) earlier this year, âbut itâs not fun to wield by yourself.â *i,i* is the solution, a collective effort as endless as it is empathetic. âRyan Dombal\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fbon-iver\u002Fi-i){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F2rXPgd9){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002Ff8a5785b){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de6e0269669180008bb6469]|||\nDrag City|||\n\n+++\n\n### 15.\n## Bill Callahan: *Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest*\n\nPlenty of people come to Bill Callahanâs music just to hear him string sentences together as he explores an absurd, beautiful world one song at a time. While Callahanâs double album *Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest* contains plenty of his signature wisdomâsongs about love and death, paternal advice and domestic romance, smirking one-liners and piercing, plainspoken verseâits magic is in the way his words wear his music like a beloved pair of old jeans. His simple arrangements for guitar, strings, and percussion are filled with purpose: Every new note and lyric is in service of communicating a pure thought.\n\nTake âWriting,â which rises slow and heavy like the sun in late summer. âIt feels good to be writing again,â Callahan sighs, stepping through a field of thickly plucked notes; in the six years since his last album, he married and fathered a son, milestones that, for a while, dulled the need to be creative. He sings about clear water flowing from his pen, and a second riff emerges, lighter and more delicate, a cool stream burbling just out of sight. Eventually he leaves words behind entirely, sinking into cascading acoustic guitars and the soft tinkle of chimes. Itâs a moment representative of this warm, humble, and remarkably graceful album: a celebration of the act of creation that reaches its peak when thereâs nothing left to say. âJamieson Cox\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fbill-callahan\u002Fshepherd-in-a-sheepskin-vest){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F2Lp12UE){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002Ff2114997){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5dee7ed3fca3b800088ab0f6]|||\nParkwood\u002FColumbia|||\n\n+++\n\n### 14.\n## BeyoncÃ©: *Homecoming: The Live Album*\n\nNo one does maximalism like BeyoncÃ©. *Homecoming: The Live Album*âthe musical companion to her retina-popping Coachella live filmâboasts a whopping 40 tracks that fuse soul, hip-hop, gospel, and go-go with live skits and confessional interludes, as brassy marching bands and black drumlines give dap to the cultural traditions of HBCUs.

While thereâs no song explicitly about her on *Jaime*, there is urgent advice about how to live with the time weâre given: by refusing hatred and spreading love in fractious times; by dismissing inattentive partners and acting on desire. That immediacy pervades the sound of Howardâs solo debut, which is less wedded to genre than her work with Alabama Shakes and Thunderbitch. When the spirit calls for sparkling old soul, itâs there, as on the perennially festive âStay Highâ; when Howard addresses a racist attack on her mixed-race parents, she doesnât smooth over the stumbling piano refrain, nor her stunned delivery.

Each song is named after a creative titan of color (Betty Davis, Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, Frida Kahlo, etc.), drawing on the subjectâs specific history as a spiritual guide for locating her own truth. *LEGACY\\! LEGACY\\!* is a more unified work than Woodsâ 2016 debut, *HEAVN,* which marked her as a graceful champion of self-love, black feminism, and her Windy City hometown. On this album, even Woodsâ more straightforward declarationsâsheâs ânot your typical girl,â sheâs âall out of fucksââare set within richly imaginative and deeply allusive contexts, rooted in her artistic forebears. The music exists on an expanded scale, too, with producer Slot-A helping guide the proceedings from cosmic soul to garage-rock grit and on through to Chicago house. âSo many women in me,â Woods sings, and she is every one. âMarc Hogan\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fjamila-woods\u002Flegacy-legacy){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F2RntY3p){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002Fdd24b495){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7dbe84072b600087744e5]|||\nDrag City|||\n\n+++\n\n### 10.\n## Purple Mountains: *Purple Mountains*\n\nWeâre used to confronting a work of crushing sadness after the artist who made it has reached a better place. Stories of depression and despair are easier to take with full knowledge of the happy ending. *Purple Mountains*, the final album of new music from David Berman, released 26 days before he took his own life at age 52, offers no such luxury. A number of lines and song titlesââThe dead know what they are doing when they leave this world behind,â from âNights That Wonât Happen,â or âNo way to last out here like this for longâ from âAll My Happiness Is Goneââseem to point at what was to come, and to hear them in a certain mood is to be emotionally overwhelmed.\n\nBut itâs important to remember what Bermanâs friends at Drag City [said](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.dragcity.com\u002Fnews\u002F2019-08-12-call-me-from-albemarle) following his death: His music didnât predict his death; it was written *despite* his depression. The best way to hear these songs now is to listen to them in that spiritâto assume Berman was fighting fire with fire. He searched for the perfectly turned phrase to articulate pain because it helped him feel less of it; he added jokes because the absurdity of life is funny. His parting gift turned out to be one of his very best records. âMark Richardson\n\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fpurple-mountains\u002Fpurple-mountains){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F2RnBScV){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002F24bcd197){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5dee843d29131e0008fba7c6]|||\nSub Pop|||\n\n+++\n\n### 9.\n## Weyes Blood: *Titanic Rising*\n\n*Titanic Rising* is vintage-sounding music for people who donât want to live in the past. On her fourth album as Weyes Blood, L.A. singer-songwriter Natalie Mering coos laughably old-fashioned lines like âtreat me right, Iâm still a good manâs daughterâ while referencing the cosmic loneliness of modern dating. You can parse out the weight, hope, and humor of Meringâs poetry, or you can sit back and let her dulcet tone and excellent taste in George Harrison-esque slide guitar wash over you. But even going the comfortable route, she is constantly disrupting her own â70s soft rock pastiche with sounds that represent the futureâspace-age synths, satellites trying to connect. This simultaneous backwards-forwards vantage point leaves Mering well-positioned to consider our current momentâeven if she sounds almost nothing like it. âJillian Mapes\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fweyes-blood\u002Ftitanic-rising){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F2RnFrQp){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002F8ce664d8){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5dee84a8fca3b800088ab0fa]|||\nTouch|||\n\n+++\n\n### 8.\n## Fennesz: *Agora*\n\nThe magic of Christian Fenneszâs work comes in the way he turns the minimal into the maximal, expanding tiny moments into huge sonic environments. When making *Agora*, his first solo album in five years, the experimental ambient producer was forced to work minimallyâafter losing his studio space, he was relegated to using headphones in a bedroomâand he translated these restrictions into one of his most oversized works yet. The albumâs four tracks are all over 10 minutes in length and unabashedly sweeping, as processed guitar tones and dense computer manipulations generate droning, nearly-orchestral waves. But each mountainous track is also filled with small details, be it a high-pitched squall, a grainy click, or a distant rumble. Like all of Fenneszâs best work, *Agora* evokes memories and the way they linger and change. But the album never feels faded or nostalgic; all of its enveloping sound is immensely present, pulsing with life. âMarc Masters\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Ffennesz\u002Fagora){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F2qoz18x){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002F4a63dad4){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7d90b238c6f0008bc0e13]|||\nRVNG Intl.|||\n\n+++\n\n### 7.\n## Helado Negro: *This Is How You Smile*\n\nThe most striking aspect of Helado Negroâs *This Is How You Smile* isnât the dreamy production, with its lush acoustic guitars wound around intimately rendered drums.

Amid all this wonder, what stays with you most is Roberto Carlos Langeâs comforting voice: Itâs resonant and entrancing in both Spanish and English as he narrates meditations on resilience and the Latinx experience. Fresh hells rear their ugly heads every day, and Helado Negro reminds us that we can care for our communities as we seek to improve a world determined to beat us down. *This Is How You Smile* effortlessly illustrates the kind of quiet rage that has come to feel increasingly common in our current reality; for that reason, it might be the finest political record of the year. âNoah Yoo\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fhelado-negro\u002Fthis-is-how-you-smile){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F2RpvKRI){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002F2f67b8b6){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7e1f94072b600087744eb]|||\nRimas|||\n\n+++\n\n### 6.\n## Bad Bunny: *X 100PRE*\n\nBy the time Bad Bunny dropped his debut LP on Christmas Eve 2018, the Puerto Rican star had already demonstrated fluency in the trap, R&B, and reggaetÃ³n sounds that dominate urbano music through a deluge of hit singles and features. But *X 100PRE* was the first time all of those musical sidesâand moreâwere presented in a singular statement. Expertly sequenced and absent of fluff, the album deploys only a choice few guest appearances designed for maximum impact: a rare Spanish verse from Drake, dirty bass programming by Diplo, and a romantic harmony courtesy of Ricky Martin. The focus instead is on flaunting Bad Bunnyâs wide stylistic range; he channels salsa king [HÃ©ctor Lavoe](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=af9gVqE9-E8) and flamboyant Mexican pop star [Juan Gabriel](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Qu49MO5FH6o) as fluently as he might modern reggaetoneros like J Balvin and Ozuna.

The lyrics are elliptical yet striking, so successful at filling you with what feels like an ancient longing that it sometimes feels like youâre discovering a new language entirely. âVrinda Jagota\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fbest-of-2019\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fbig-thief\u002Fu-f-o-f){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fapple.co\u002F2LqFreu){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](http:\u002F\u002Ftidd.ly\u002Fc26ce03a){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de6c6d19eef880008cd118f]|||\nYoung Turks|||\n\n+++\n\n### 2.\n## FKA twigs: *MAGDALENE*\n\nFKA twigsâ second album plays like an unsparing breakup manual for a distant species, some glamorous alien race presumably as brilliant at everything as she is: singing, producing, writing, dancing, seducing, exorcising, empathizing. *MAGDALENE* is an overwhelming collection of intimacies, a generous feat of communication that turns her specific pain (not all of us have to get over a breakup with a [celluloid vampire](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cosmopolitan.com\u002Fentertainment\u002Fcelebs\u002Fa29746708\u002Ffka-twigs-robert-pattinson-magdalene-breakup-details\u002F)) into communion.\n\nFor all the clever syntheses in *MAGDALENE*âs productionâpolyphonic vocals wisping over bass shudders; operatic trills distorted into grisly yelpsâtwigs is desperately clear in her words.

When she first crash-landed into the public consciousness in 2011, breathily cooing about [video games](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=cE6wxDqdOV0) and [blue jeans](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=z-6cCmxaGoQ), the artist formerly known as Lizzy Grant was engulfed in heated debates over her authenticity, whether or not she was in control of her creative output, and whether she deserved her success at all. (As if the Bowies and Madonnas of the world didnât spend decades proving that an artistâs greatest triumphs can come from reinvention.) But she ignored the haters and plowed forward, steadily carving out her own dark corner of the pop landscape. *Norman Fucking Rockwell!* takes that journey one step further: It cements Del Rey as a newly emergent Great American Songwriter.\n\nThe elements of the Lana Del Rey Cinematic Universe, as established in the *Born to Die* era, have remained consistent throughout her discography: Lynchian dreamscapes of haunted prom queens and suburban ennui, meditations on the death of the American Dream, Old Hollywood glamour, the agony and ecstasy of bad men, references to classic rock and Comp Lit 101. On *Norman Fucking Rockwell!*, her songwriting at last goes toe-to-toe with the grandeur of her ideas. Her lyrics are dense poems destined for academic scrutiny, anchored by the kind of dry wit that could come as easily from the pen of Dorothy Parker as from a really good Instagram caption. Del Reyâs attitude towards destructive relationships take a refreshing turn, giving her more agency than ever before: âYouâre fun and youâre wild\u002FBut you donât know the half of the shit that you put me through\u002FYour poetryâs bad and you blame the news,â she sings wearily on the title track. ââCause youâre just a man\u002FItâs just what you do.â (Because the reality of loving a fast-living, leather jacket-clad Romeo on a motorcycle is that you also have to deal with his bullshit.) Later, on âVenice Bitch,â sheâs âfresh out of fucks forever,â like so many of us aspire to be. On âThe Greatest,â she takes a widescreen look at our planet, sighing into the void as climate change brings about a hellish endless summer.\n\nDel Reyâs melodies also find their ideal setting in producer Jack Antonoffâs airy Laurel Canyon psych-folk, where she follows in the lineage of Joni Mitchell and Carole King. Untethered from the electronic pop and hip-hop trappings of many of her previous songs, her vocals breathe deep and her melodies luxuriate. Nothing here aims anywhere near the top 40; to paraphrase Del Reyâs buddy Kacey Musgraves, sheâs classic in the right way.\n\n*Norman Fucking Rockwell!* is an album that arrived feeling like a greatest hits collection. Future generations will marvel that one album contained âVenice Bitchâ *and* âMariners Apartment Complexâ *and* âhope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but i have it.â And they will scoff in disbelief that Lana Del Rey was once treated as anything but the poet laureate of a world on fire. âAmy Phillips\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough

Take âIf I Canât Have You,â a sparkling single propelled by gargantuan Elton John piano chords and a glorious descending vocal line that should squeeze stress sweat out of Justin Timberlake.

But DJ Nateâs power is restraint: With a stream of warm TR-808 hits and a few errant hi-hats, he allows the footworkers who compete in [dizzying dance battles](https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FPJxX979zxWE) to fill in the energy. The titular vocal sample, chopped into oblivion, is a suitable mantra: Nate returned to footwork while recovering from an injury that left him temporarily paralyzed from the waist down, a particularly cruel irony in a scene defined by movement.

A potent juxtaposition of crashing noise music and pure ideals, â13th Century Metalâ feels unconquerable, a maelstrom settling into place. âSheldon Pearce\n\n__Listen:__ [Brittany Howard, â13th Century Metalâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=gUuuFGFpBlU)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de68ee9b517ce000899ee8c]|||\nijn inc.|||\n\n+++\n\n### 97.\n## Klein: âClaim Itâ\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest shock on Kleinâs latest album, *Lifetime,* is the appearance of a halfway conventional beat. Nestled among an album of brilliantâif sometimes exhaustingâintensity, âClaim Itâ is a pause for thought as the South London producer peels back the sticky layers of her songs to reveal the textural skill beneath. What emerges is a strangled, melodic hook offset by unsettling vocal effects and chords that spiral upwards in a nervous twist of energy. Like a single malt whiskey with a drop of spring water, âClaim Itâ both dilutes and liberates Kleinâs distinctive musical flavor, a reminder from this most maximalist of producers that less can occasionally be more. âBen Cardew\n\n__Listen:__ [Klein, âClaim Itâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=0_B8dMObh3w)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de68fa1c43b7100080dda6f]|||\nBeauty Marks|||\n\n+++\n\n### 96.\n## Ciara: âThinkin Bout Youâ\n\n\nIf âThinkin Bout Youâ is any indication, even after three years of marriage to her football-star husband, Ciara is still in the honeymoon stage. As she puts it: Heâs a habit she canât break; heâs her destiny. The exhilarating track from her seventh studio album, *Beauty Marks*, follows the singer in the throes of infatuation, with a throwback disco beat that mimics her joy. The songâs straightforward production matches the force of her emotions; little more than a simple beat, bassline, and backing vocals elevate her voice. Itâs a rare, all-out work of pop from Ciara, and her voice glides over every line as she gives in to the force of her heart. âColin Lodewick\n\n__Listen:__ [Ciara, âThinkin Bout Youâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=kVczk4uIPPg)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de69213238c6f0008bc0d4b]|||\nAnti-|||\n\n+++\n\n### 95.\n## Boy Scouts: âGet Well Soonâ\n\n\nThe heartbreaker and the heartbrokenâaka the villain and the victimâare often the stock characters in songs about failing relationships. On âGet Well Soon,â Taylor Vick, the Oakland-based folk-pop singer who has performed as Boy Scouts for nearly a decade, chooses instead to look at how breaking someoneâs heart can break yours, too. Singing over her lilting guitar, she makes it known that her decision is a compassionate act.

He has an eccentric and versatile ear for melody similar to Thug, and has even remixed his songs. But Keed is more than just another Young Thug clone. On âItâs Up Freestyle,â Keed perfects his high-pitched delivery, screeching and harmonizing over a beat from JetsonMade that sounds ready for a dystopian sci-fi movie. Whether heâs rapping at an inhuman pace or piecing together his ad-libs, whatever leaves Keedâs mouth is recitable: âWalked in, walked in, this Bentley truck you can crawl in,â he wails on a hook thatâs since gone viral on TikTok.

Their sound is shamelessly opulent and sumptuous with rot, like fruit losing its color but deepening in scent.\n\nIf Ferreiraâs previous album *Night Time, My Time* channeled â90s alt-pop, âDownhill Lullabyâ nods to the decadeâs trip-hop with languid drums and bass, dank atmosphere, and a vague seediness. Ferreiraâs vocals alternate from husky and over-heavy to lullaby-plaintive, then slide into the vulnerability that's marked her best songs. She sings about a relationship thatâs not healthy yet no longer up for reconsideration; around her, the strings swoop and keen as if they're racing to the ground, too. âKatherine St. Asaph\n\n__Listen:__ [Sky Ferreira, âDownhill Lullabyâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=n8x55qS3chA)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de69464b517ce000899eec2]|||\nSkint|||\n\n+++\n\n### 92.\n## RÃ³isÃ­n Murphy: âIncapableâ\n\n\nRÃ³isÃ­n Murphy begins âIncapableâ as cheerfully as its disco-ready bassline suggests she will. The Irish dance-pop vet is ready to move, happy to feel wanted and free, even boasting that sheâs never had a broken heart. But soon, the songâs steady groove and bright handclaps underpin a growing skepticism, as her perfectly intact heart begins to strike her as its own worrisome condition. âAm I incapable of love?â she asks herself. Though the song may be tongue-in-cheek, it highlights one of dance musicâs core truths: Even a great beat canât shield you from self-doubt. âColin Lodewick\n\n__Listen:__ [RÃ³isÃ­n Murphy, âIncapableâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=H02BPY7vEms)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de694edc43b7100080dda71]|||\nPolyvinyl|||\n\n+++\n\n### 91.\n## Jay Som: âSuperbikeâ\n\n\nNothing symbolizes freedom quite like the pairing of a motorcycle and open road. Itâs a staple of American mythos; itâs the central conceit of Jay Somâs âSuperbike.â Melina Duterte, who helms the project, is sparing with her imagery, piecing together the story as if from glimpses out a moving vehicle: hurt followed by hope, a two-wheeled escape, a painful memory. What she canât fit into words plays out in the songâs swirl of major-key jangle, shoegaze fuzz, and tambourine, all churning like air currents.

With its rustic arrangement and domestic imagery, it sounds like a spiritual sequel to âNew Yearâs Day,â the acoustic cleansing that closes 2017âs divisive *Reputation*. Both songs are tributes to the dirty work that goes into keeping a relationship healthy, and theyâre spiked with the fear and doubt people feel even when that work is paying off. How can you make sure a good thing lasts forever?\n\nâLoverâ features a classically swooning, Swiftian bridgeâone designed to soundtrack wedding vows in renovated barns until the end of timeâbut its most penetrating lines depict the unglamorous stuff: telling dirty jokes, saving seats, deciding whether or not to drag out the air mattress for your college friends. This is the stuff of real intimacy, of partnership, of creating a language and a life together.

Backed by an orchestra that sounds plucked from Hollywoodâs Golden Age, she sings with compassion and grace to a lover she likens to a bird sheâs releasing from its cage. The contrast between the rhapsodic instrumentals and Korkejianâs stoic, heavy-lidded alto draws out the disparity between what is felt and what is said when lovers part ways. Bedouineâs heroine stares wistfully at the night into which her bird has flown off, the echoes of their final words implied by avian flute trills.

As the song continues, these disruptions become more frequent, building to a tempest of discord thatâs cathartic, indulgent, and kind of silly.

His own music is a logical evolution of their writing, even more vulnerable and irrepressibly sad. âPop Outâ was his breakout, the track that introduced his sorrow-stricken voice to the masses. Although itâs set against a backdrop of actionâthe robbery in the chorus is detailed with the kinetic precision of a Brian De Palma filmâits real drama is internal, as Polo G processes the toll that playing the villain takes on your psyche. He may be the shooter, but in Polo Gâs world, everybodyâs a casualty.\n\nTelling his story, Polo G makes every word matter.

On the first single from his sequel to the 2008 Mount Eerie album *Lost Wisdom,* he and collaborator Julie Doiron zoom out from the everyday minutiae of grief, excavating a broader-reaching poetics from blunt observation. âWhat glows beneath all the pain and anguish?â Elverum and Doiron ask in an asymmetrical call-and-response.\n\nThe answer is love, of course. In this pairâs hands, love is an infinitely unruly concept, however concise their words and simple their musical arrangement, which doesnât thicken much beyond the yawn of an organ and some distorted guitar. In his 2004 song âWe Squirm,â Elverum characterized feelings as âcaptorsâ from which weâll never be free. Here, love is rendered as a horizon, a void; itâs beautiful and itâs terrifying, and it goes on forever.

The songâs punky disco bounce is less an invitation to pose for the paparazzi than the soundtrack to a daily drill of skincare routines and make-up applications.

Her words, spiked with equal parts apathy, opulence, and menace, echoed in Jamila Woodsâ mind as she worked on her second album, *LEGACY! LEGACY!*, a monument to black excellence. Like Hurston, the namesake of the albumâs first single, Woods is something of a polymath: a singer-songwriter, poet, teacher, and activist. But on âZORA,â she asserts that her selfhood is far more expansive than these labels, or any others thrust upon her, would suggest. âLittle boxes you canât stick unto me,â she sings, her vocals melting over a commanding backbeat. As if with a finger wag, she adds, âYou will never know everything.â But thereâs sweetness even in Woodsâ venom, as when she taunts her foes by threatening to âtenderly fill [them] with white light.â Itâs another nod to her multitudes: White light contains every color of the rainbow. âOlivia Horn\n\n__Listen:__ [Jamila Woods, âZORAâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=NO0_3XwBb5s)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de6d7469eef880008cd11cb]|||\nColumbia|||\n\n+++\n\n### 47.\n## Caroline Polachek: âDoorâ\n\n\nSometimes the difference between a good pop song and a great one lies in the sticky details: [a borrowed bassline](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=NZKXkD6EgBk), [a baby coo](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.dailymotion.com\u002Fvideo\u002Fxx11j), [the loop of a tumbi melody](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=FPoKiGQzbSQ).

He has Crohnâs disease, and heâs repeatedly expressed the desire to transcend his own fleshy form. Yet over four fearless albums, his physicality has occupied an ever-greater part of his work. In *The Sun Still Burns Here*, a dance piece from Hadreas and Seattle-based dancer Kate Wallich, it becomes the totality: One preview described part of the performance as âessentially a fully clothed orgy,â for which Hadreas both composed the score and performs as a dancer. On âEye in the Wall,â the first song released from the project, he commands fragmented images of a body to become whole, âwild and free,â leaving him âfull of feelingâ¦full of nothing but love.â He issues these instructions in a louche warble, his twang and metallic shimmer gathering into a nine-minute reverie of Afro-Latin percussion and searing, silvery brightness that captures the incandescent feeling of physical abandon. âLaura Snapes\n\n__Listen:__ [Perfume Genius, âEye in the Wallâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=oply9BPy6nU)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de6daef238c6f0008bc0d97]|||\nRepublic|||\n\n+++\n\n### 45.\n## Ariana Grande: âNASAâ\n\n\nNASA, probably the only popular U.S. government agency left, was everywhere this year: T-shirts and patches bearing its charmingly retro insignia became a [bona fide trend](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.latimes.com\u002Fbusiness\u002Fstory\u002F2019-07-19\u002Fnasa-logo-shirts-swimsuits-everything), and Ariana Grande pulled its name for a sneaky sleeper hit from *thank u, next.* On an album largely about the joys of being unattached, âNASAâ offers a nuance: the freedom to be attached, just not right now. âI canât really miss you if Iâm with you,â Grande offers, gently reminding a lover that intimacy doesnât mean constant proximity.

The track is a perfect expression of a distinctly modern anxiety: being stranded in a place with no cell signal, dying to know whatâs going on in someone elseâs head. From the creeping intensity of the glimmering background synth to the perfectly imperfect way her voice skids when she hits the high notes, Yanya encapsulates the explosive tantrum feeling of not being able to reach *or* read someone, when in theory we should have their thoughts at our fingertips.

As he sits by the titular airplaneâs window, âflying through some stock footage of heaven,â he compares the celestial sight to an infantâs purity. âThis must be the light you saw\u002FThat just left you screaming,â he sings over sweetly plucked guitar. âAnd this must be the light you saw\u002FBefore our eyes could disguise true meaning.â He is certain that we lose this vision in time, each year getting further from that light. But, Callahan argues, we are doing the best we can. â747â is not a criticism of our transformation from wide-eyed infants to weary elders, but a tranquil acknowledgement of its inevitability. âMadison Bloom\n\n__Listen:__ [Bill Callahan, â747â](https:\u002F\u002Fbillcallahan.bandcamp.com\u002Ftrack\u002F747)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de6e0d0238c6f0008bc0d9b]|||\nColumbia|||\n\n+++\n\n### 38.\n## Bruce Springsteen: âHello Sunshineâ\n\n\nOn *Western Stars*, a Springsteen album full of character studies, the protagonist of âHello Sunshineâ may be the one who most resembles the man himself.

As a narrator, Cox expresses a kind of numb acceptance, and the scenery he offersâthe rotting houses and rusted enginesâare as bleak and beautiful as the songâs sweeping pianos and gentle guitar licks.

Itâs unclear if anyoneâs listening, but that makes it all the more tragic. The funky bass riff and disco drums mock her distress, setting the scene for a dance where our heroine has no partner: âI ran to you and you know why,â she shouts at the empty barstool next to her. âTrue Blueâ is the sound of taking your heartache out for a night on the townâyou might be able to sedate it with booze and loud music, but you will wake up in its arms the next morning. âMadison Bloom\n\n__Listen:__ [Mark Ronson, âTrue Blueâ [ft.

The imagery is familiar, yet the New Zealand-born\u002FWales-based artist deploys it in a way that makes these everyday objects sound off-kilter and foreign, like signs held askew to point in a direction few have traveled. She arranges the songâa standout on her third album, the folk-pop gem *Designer*âso it builds gradually, adding new elements that subtly reshape its flow.

Mercifully, Rico Nasty returned with her dynamic brand of catharsis, smashing through walls like a pint-sized Kool-Aid Man. *Anger Management*, her collaborative project with the producer Kenny Beats, was released just as spring arrived, but by summer, Rico seemed to have gotten fight music out of her system. In July, she dropped âTime Flies,â a Dee B-produced loosie that appears on the *Madden NFL 20* soundtrack. Ironically, the song sounds more like the brief, intoxicating respite that comes after scream therapy than the dyspeptic fury youâd expect of anything associated with the NFL. Sparkly, melodic, and ultimately optimistic, âTime Fliesâ recalls the treacly, animated energy of Ricoâs early days. As the beat bubbles and then strikes, she catalogs her pain; there is loss, fear, undeserved hate. But even as the reasons for Ricoâs anger persist, her own attitude helps spur transformation: âGot tired of complaining\u002FI got up and changed my situation,â she sings. As summer turned into fall, that sentiment proved just as useful as her anger has been. âRawiya Kameir\n\n__Listen:__ [Rico Nasty, âTime Fliesâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=oIYgNhz2ty8)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7ce209669180008bb6517]|||\nMexican Summer|||\n\n+++\n\n### 29.\n## Cate Le Bon: âDaylight Mattersâ\n\n\nCate Le Bon finds the beauty in isolation. On âDaylight Matters,â from her delightfully eccentric fifth album *Reward*, she spins repetitive, circuitous speech patterns into delicate bridges and euphoric choruses. âLove you, I love you, I love you, I love you,â she sings, her wistful voice foreshadowing the twist: âBut youâre not here.â The lilting vocal gives off the impression of talking to yourself, the sort of compulsive self-soothing that springs up in seclusion. The melancholy is a reflection of Le Bonâs environment: She composed *Reward* in the near-solitude of Englandâs mountainous Lake District. Cloaked in dreamy synths and rounded saxophone, âDaylight Mattersâ hints at glam rockâs bravado while retaining Le Bonâs characteristic playfulness. Itâs as if weâve been let into her colorful interior world, witness to the elaborate orchestra sheâs constructed to fill in the empty space. âArielle Gordon\n\n__Listen:__ [Cate Le Bon, âDaylight Mattersâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=WjduOTMn9dw)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7d7379eef880008cd12e1]|||\nSub Pop|||\n\n+++\n\n### 28.\n## Weyes Blood: âAndromedaâ\n\n\nIn the early weeks of 2019, Natalie Mering shared a subtly disorienting video for âAndromeda,â the first single from *Titanic Rising*, her masterful fourth album as Weyes Blood. The song itself is all sweeping Laurel Canyon haze: a hook thatâs almost entirely pedal steel guitar and a sad, swooning vocal delivery that seems coated in FM static. While her music has felt increasingly connected to classic rock radio, this songâwith its analog hum and open road grandeurâsignaled a deeper inquiry into whatâs so *classic* about those old standbys. The video, however, looked more like a Y2K-era screensaver on a desktop computer: a steady, slightly pixelated flow of distant stars in an endless black sky. This melding of our recent and distant pasts is crucial to Meringâs songwriting; she moves forward by studying where weâve been, rendering it both familiar and somewhat uncanny. âSam Sodomsky\n\n__Listen:__ [Weyes Blood, âAndromedaâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=StSEXZcwOB4)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7d78eb9e6f50008a30626]|||\nJagjaguwar|||\n\n+++\n\n### 27.\n## Bon Iver: âHey, Maâ\n\n\nTwo-and-a-half minutes into âHey, Ma,â the music fades to silence, the song grows calm, and Justin Vernonâs voice emerges almost naked, mostly free of the effects that have colored his vocals since 2007âs *For Emma, Forever Ago*. Itâs a powerful moment: one of the most influential musicians of the 21st century stripping everything away so he can sing directly to you. The words might sound unsettled and unspecificâsomething about waiting outside, going into a room, learning the truthâbut heâs always made a virtue out of impressionistic lyrics. This is a song less about communication than connection: Who keeps you grounded? Who pulls you out of the coal mine and into the real world? Over time, Vernon expanded Bon Iver to include a small townâs worth of musicians and [even a dance troupe](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.tudance.org), and together theyâve created a rousing arena anthem suitable for the ambitious tour they launched earlier this year. âHey, Maâ wants you to get those lighters upâor your phone or your hands or whateverâand join in. âStephen Deusner\n\n__Listen:__ [Bon Iver, âHey, Maâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=HDAKS18Gv1U)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7d7dd9669180008bb6519]|||\nWarp|||\n\n+++\n\n### 26.\n## Danny Brown: âDirty Laundryâ\n\n\nOn any given night in America, there is an open mic event where a green comedian jokes about paying strippers with change and inevitably uses the phrase âmaking it hail.â No one laughs. On âDirty Laundry,â being a broke, horny schmuck is the setup instead of the punchline, and Danny Brown kills. He recounts awkward drug sales, a hookup in a Burger King bathroom, and two encounters with a stripper: as a client and as a fellow patron at a laundromat. Skeevy and giddy, he makes the gutter sound like a theme park.\n\nBrown has been telling offbeat stories his entire career, and Q-Tipâs bouncy productionâa funky drip of beeps, gurgly synths, and stretched vocal samplesâaccents his poise. The rapper sounds at ease over this colorful backdrop, his laundry-themed wordplay as loose and entertaining as it is technical. These gonzo escapades lack the teeth-chattering urgency of Brownâs previous music, but ultimately, his dirty-uncle act comes across as relief. Heâs a full showman here, his bits polished, his delivery smooth.

Again and again, she ventures into dank places and emerges with observations that are striking for their lucid originality and humor. On âAshes to Ashes,â she tills the sediments of sex, art, and mortality, dragging ash from a cigarette into a grave and equating penetrating fingers to the double-digit swipe of a phone screen to a frantic drowning kick. The song takes place in a dream and preserves dream logic, psychologically cogent yet somehow logically inexplicable. Hval threads it together with a trance pulse that buffets these ideas across the wake-sleep divide like marbles in a Newtonâs cradle.

She has spent her career shapeshifting between genres and personas, from solo folkie to barnstorming indie bandleader to Mark Ronson- collaborating pop singer. On âAll Mirrors,â the title track of her latest album, Olsen introduced her latest (and perhaps greatest) incarnation: mighty goth sorceress. The song unfurls like the train of a black satin wedding gown, undulating on a bed of sinister, classic-Hollywood strings and subtle synth pulses. Olsen intones ominously about lost beauty, being buried alive, and repeating the past, building to the kind of cathartic climax that demands to be shouted from a windswept cliff in a fierce rainstorm (preferably while wearing the elaborate bejeweled headpiece from the songâs striking [music video](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Jjt698Zv5jQ)).

The fragmented story that unfolds against crisp, quiet hi-hats and warm piano chords has a nostalgic quality, though itâs hard to know if Lange is acknowledging someone from his past, present, or future. âI feel you\u002FIn my mind\u002FAll the time,â he sings with care, revealing the kind of love he feels: implicit, unconditional.

In the piano-ballad closer of *Norman Fucking Rockwell!*, she offers a few clues: She finds inspiration from Sylvia Plath and photographer Slim Aarons. Sheâs not quite happy but sheâs definitely not sad.\n \nBecause the arrangement never picks upâitâs just Jack Antonoffâs muted piano, his pauses as loud as the chords themselvesâDel Rey pushes the dynamics with her vocal delivery, building to a whispered falsetto as affecting as any of her most elaborate crescendos. Once upon a time, listening to her music meant scouring all the references and layers to find the reasons for the apocalyptic dread in her voice, the slow-burning romance in her melodies, the nostalgic haze of her videos.

Eventually, Gretel pushes the evil creature into an oven, frees her caged sibling, and the pair escape. Philadelphia bedroom-pop hero (Sandy) Alex Gâs abstract update of the story, a highlight from his album *House of Sugar*, is decidedly darker: Gretel leaves her brother behind and ends up consumed not by the misdeed, but by her own twisted desire to return to the candy-coated lair. The song's mix of sped-up and untreated vocals suggests its namesake's split psyche, while its ominous main guitar riff is constantly brushing up against more whimsical musical flourishes.

His talky flows scan as bar-heavy despite most of his raps being filler, simply because their ferocity can raze beats to cinders.

The track carries the Prince allusions often ascribed to Paulâclanging synths only enhance the â80s flavorâbut thereâs a new earnestness to the song that becomes apparent toward the bridge. Paulâs voice breaks away from all affect, and it sounds as though weâre hearing him sing into the booth through the talkback button in a studioâs control room, unadorned and unmicâd.

The pair delivers some of the yearâs most-recited lyrics: Meganâs capitalist-feminism (âYeah Iâm in my bag but Iâm in his tooâ) was inescapable, both as a club staple and as a trending social media philosophy.

But even in its ubiquity, âCash Shitâ didnât get oldâarguably, in part, because Megan and DaBaby both rap about sex like they have plenty of it, a transcendent feat among their peers whoâve been clouded in a low-libido haze.

Its bassline is a lure, the hi-hat a metronome for your sacrum to ride. Multi-part harmonies and singsong back-and-forth between Solange and The-Dream feel like peering into a closed session. âBinzâ is a banger, a sunny break from the self-serious mood of *When I Get Home*. To call it an âinterstitialâ is to acknowledge its place in how we listen to music in this day and age. False starts while scanning a playlist, tinny snares from passing headphones, auto-play in all of your feeds: In 2019, sound is primarily experienced as fleeting. âAnupa Mistry\n\n__Listen:__ [Solange, âBinzâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=83LeK-t-kTw)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7dec89669180008bb651d]|||\nDarkroom\u002FInterscope|||\n\n+++\n\n### 10.\n## Billie Eilish: âbad guyâ\n\n\nâbad guyâ jumps out by *not* jumping out. Its volume drops abruptly, pulling the listener in close, making them strain to catch the breath braided so exquisitely by Billie Eilish and her co-producer\u002Fbrother, Finneas OâConnell. A pop miniaturist who shuns grand vocal acrobatics, she skirts the edge of inaudible to invent a new kind of subdued sass. Her virtuosity is in tone and texture: the delicious derision of âduh,â the way she smudges consonants and crumbles vowels in her mouth. Apart from the occasional deliberately unsubtle effect, like the juddering digital croak on the chorus, itâs an artfully crafted illusion of intimacy.\n\nâbad guyâ is a crawlspace of a track that feels like itâs made of the same whispery fabric as Eilishâs voice: clicks, whirrs, fingersnaps, and ear-tickling sounds that prompt ASMR tingles. Furtive and nimble, the beat moves just like her lines about âcreeping around like no one knows,â yet the bass, when it hits, has the dancefloor heft of trap. As for Eilishâs jaded goth-pop schtick? Those who can only remember being teenage may smile at lines like âMy soul? So cynical.â But for the actual teens whoâve followed her rise to the top of the charts, Eilish captures the tender mess of being young and alive. âSimon Reynolds\n\n__Listen:__ [Billie Eilish, âbad guyâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7df284072b600087744e9]|||\n4AD|||\n\n+++\n\n### 9.\n## Big Thief: âNotâ\n\n\nWith the release of the cosmic *U.F.O.F.* in May, Big Thief seemed content to spend 2019 suspended above Earth. They came crashing down with âNot.â The standout lead single from *Two Hands*, the quartetâs *second* incredible record of the year, is driven by carnal desperation.\n\nAs a lyricist, Adrianne Lenker captures even the most abstract observations with profound precision. On âNot,â she uses that vivid specificity to outline an absence, her voice snarling and burning as she prowls around the indescribable. But like everything Big Thief does, the songâs stunning impact comes not from one bandmate, but from the collective whole; its force is the result of four intertwined spirits carving into themselves in hopes of digging up some sort of raw, corporeal clarity. When âNotâ finally crescendos into a scorched-earth guitar solo, it feels more like an exorcism than an exhale. âQuinn Moreland\n\n__Listen:__ [Big Thief, âNotâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=UIcVwH47uxQ)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7df7eb517ce000899efaf]|||\nSony|||\n\n+++\n\n### 8.\n## RosalÃ­a \u002F J Balvin: âCon Alturaâ\n\n\nâCon Alturaâ roughly translates to âdo it hard,â according to RosalÃ­a, who borrowed the phrase from [a Dominican TV personality](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.diariolibre.com\u002Frevista\u002Fmusica\u002Flocutor-mariachi-budda-en-los-creditos-de-la-cancion-con-altura-de-rosalia-y-j-balvin-ED13326233). The song is aptly named, with the Catalan singer and Colombian star J Balvin exchanging swaggering verses that name-drop the Porsche Panamera and the flamenco icon CamarÃ³n de la Isla over a watertight reggaeton beat. El Guincho, who co-produced this and much of RosalÃ­aâs breakthrough album *El Mal Querer*, also adds a brief vocal, his contribution a reminder of his days as a solo star in the Iberian underground.\n \nâCon Alturaâ invites the listener to admire the wonderful flex of Latin pop in the late 2010s: the way RosalÃ­aâs flamenco inflection leans into the Caribbean pulse, how J Balvin takes on a larger-than-life, hip-hop bluster. Itâs a perfect pop song of thrilling energy and dexterity. The songâs chorus alone is so rhythmically irresistible, it makes you wonder why Spanish wasnât *always* popâs lingua franca. âBen Cardew\n\n__Listen:__ [RosalÃ­a \u002F J Balvin, âCon Alturaâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=p7bfOZek9t4)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7dfcbb517ce000899efb1]|||\nXL|||\n\n+++\n\n### 7.\n## Thom Yorke: âDawn Chorusâ\n\n\nAfter the death of Rachel Owenâhis former partner and the mother of his childrenâThom Yorke, like many before, sought relief in Thom Yorke songs. He speaks of his return to creativity, and the way music airlifts the grief-stricken from despondency, in near-mystical terms. âIf itâs needed,â he [told *the New York Times*](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002Finteractive\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F28\u002Fmagazine\u002Fthom-yorke-radiohead-interview.html), âit will find you.â Perhaps itâs telling that, on the solo album *ANIMA*, Yorke appears to confront his loss on a song called âDawn Chorus.â Itâs a title (if not the same composition) that fluttered around Radiohead lore for years. Famous to fans for its incompletion, it may, to Yorke, have symbolized refuge and endurance.\n\nOn its glassy surface, the mournful lyrics are typically inscrutable. But the tone is one of illuminationâa sense, rare in Yorkeâs music, that the light at the end of the tunnel was daybreak, after all, and not just another false dawn. Its title, which refers to the birdsong that accompanies sunrise, could represent resolution, or perhaps the bittersweet end of a glorious night. Maybe itâs just a âbloody racket,â as Yorke mutters, riffing on how one manâs symphony is anotherâs dirge. The prettiest songs, he reminds us, will always be both at once. âJazz Monroe\n\n__Listen:__ [Thom Yorke, âDawn Chorusâ](https:\u002F\u002Fopen.spotify.com\u002Ftrack\u002F0F4EoaMJmWNz8vS8tKgsqY)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7dffe238c6f0008bc0e19]|||\nJagjaguwar|||\n\n+++\n\n### 6.\n## Sharon Van Etten: âSeventeenâ\n\n\nAfter decades of owning [the age of 17](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Dn8-4tjPxD8), Stevie Nicks finally passed the torch. Let Sharon Van Etten be the new author of your 17th year: She knows its allure and innocence, how it feels to be on the cusp of adulthood. She knows the paradox of being a teen is that itâs all over soon, but it will stay with you forever. âSeventeen,â her anthem from *Remind Me Tomorrow,* is the climax of her journey from quiet cafÃ© folk singer to venerable rock star. It rolls like a boulder down a mile-long hill, pushed by a synth-rock snare and a seething, roaming performance from Van Etten as she feels every single word. When she performs the song live, she strafes around the stage, microphone in hand, like sheâs searching the crowd for someone, until she finally finds her younger self among them and delivers the coup de grÃ¢ce: âAfraid that youâll be just like me.â How she invokes time, self, youth, guilt, and forgiveness with just one line reveals the masterful craft of Van Etten on one of her greatest songs yet.  âJeremy D.

Luckily, with âCaro,â urbano shapeshifter Bad Bunny offers a more practical solution to embracing your worth. The song rescues ideas of empowerment from sponsored hashtag hell, with the Puerto Rican star flicking off critics of his androgynous style and class-collapsing brashness over a trap beat thatâs as quietly menacing as an alien hovercraft. âDonât you see that Iâm expensive?â he spits in Spanish, voicing the indignance of anyone whoâs been made to feel undeserving because of what they wear or who they love. Then, midway, the sinister instrumental evaporates, and Bad Bunny is joined by none other than Ricky Martinâwho was once lambasted by Puerto Rican clergy members after he came out as gayâfor a cloud-parting bridge that exposes the songâs pristine core: âWhy canât I just be?â they plead. âWhat harm is it to you? Iâm just happy.â Itâs a startlingly vulnerable moment, one that makes this anthem of acceptance that much more invincible. âRyan Dombal\n\n__Listen:__ [Bad Bunny, âCaroâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=bg64AFnRnkc)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7e242b9e6f50008a30631]|||\nAtlantic|||\n\n+++\n\n### 4.\n## Charli XCX \u002F Christine and the Queens: âGoneâ\n\n\nA high-octane bridge between the rave-ups of Charli XCXâs past and the sleek robo-pop of her present, âGoneâ is the best Charli of both worlds. The songâs central tension is nothing newâbeing surrounded by people yet feeling so aloneâbut how she chooses to alleviate that pain is something special: with a bombastic, bulletproof synth-pop chorus that revels in the roiling chaos of social anxiety. Christine and the Queensâ HÃ©loÃ¯se Letissier is Charliâs perfect foil, adding her own cryptic ruminations on self-isolation over spiky synth stabs and glittering, glitched-out effects. The [titillating video](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=chSZCtLrgz8) for âGone,â with Charli and Chris chained to and then dancing atop a white sports car in the rain, only solidified the songâs place as one of the most cathartic moments in pop this year. âEric Torres\n\n__Listen:__ [Charli XCX \u002F Christine and the Queens, âGoneâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=chSZCtLrgz8)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7e278b517ce000899efb4]|||\nFader|||\n\n+++\n\n### 3.\n## Clairo: âBagsâ\n\n\nThe relationships in Clairoâs songs always teeter on the edge of chaos. On âBags,â the lead single from her debut album, *Immunity*, the Gen Z pop songwriter sings with the kind of bittersweetness that could either herald the beginning of a new romance or signal its smoldering end. The image she paints repeatedly in the chorusââwalking out the door with your bagsââhangs frozen like a still from a movie, melancholic and unabating. Behind her, though, a synthesizer chirps like a second, excitable singer. Itâs as if Clairo is envisioning a breakup at the very moment of the first kiss, the sparks and the sadness translucent and overlaid on top of each other. How do you savor intimacy when you can foresee its failure in vivid detail? âBagsâ outlines the fight to stay present in the good stuff, even when your brain is fast-forwarding to the collapse. âSasha Geffen\n\n__Listen:__ [Clairo, âBagsâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=L9HYJbe9Y18)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7e2b8b517ce000899efb6]|||\nPolydor\u002FInterscope|||\n\n+++\n\n### 2.\n## Lana Del Rey: âThe Greatestâ\n\n\nOn âThe Greatest,â the big oneâthe ultimate disasterâlooms large. Civilization teeters toward oblivion, the temperature climbs upward, and Lana Del Rey is our soothsayer. She narrates these end times with a wry resignation thatâs nostalgic and tactile, dreamy yet prickly. Pining for Long Beach and a lost lover, missing the music and nightlife of New York, her response to the future is to cling to her past. Sheâs had a ball, but as she flips through the photo album, she concedes that the culture is a little too lit, that the heat is making her breath feel heavy.\n\nThe gut punch of the song is that despite her exhaustion, she sounds fulfilled. There's contentment in her voice as it floats over Jack Antonoff's sour guitar chords and soft keys, as if sheâs savoring her just desserts. This isnât just a character study, though: As one woman's world goes up in smoke, Del Rey zooms out to observe other anguishes: Kanye West is a shadow of himself; Hawaii is panicked by fictional missile strikes; David Bowieâs vision of life on Mars is now being pursued by Elon Musk. As her voice drops to a whisper, she takes in this surreal and depressing panoramaâ*what a truly ludicrous ending, right?*âthen suddenly she perks up. Why? Because thereâs a livestream to watch. The greatest loss of all, it turns out, is our attention spans. âStephen Kearse\n\n__Listen:__ [Lana Del Rey, âThe Greatestâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Ndo8r_Hg_lg)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5de7e2f9b517ce000899efb8]|||\nYoung Turks|||\n\n+++\n\n### 1.\n## FKA twigs: âcellophaneâ\n\n\nItâs nearly impossible to separate the physicality of FKA twigsâ work from her voiceâshe moves with the trained precision of an athlete, changes costumes as if sheâs shedding skin, and carries herself with the dramatic flair of a Shakespearean thespian. Projecting strength in moments of extreme fragility feels like itâs become part of her routine more recently; a very public breakup with her Hollywood ex was followed by the discovery of a medical condition anchored in her uterus. This yearâs *MAGDALENE* was twigsâ exorcism of those woesâthe ones that suddenly appear on your doorstep, the ones brewing internallyâwith âcellophaneâ as its final absolution.\n\nHeartbreak is a trial so delicate that the slightest degree of pressure can shift whether it ends in acceptance or despair. On âcellophane,â twigs recognizes that fissure and puts on an acrobatic display of deciding whether sheâll dip a toe into the darkness of its void. Itâs a song best listened to alone, where the beauty of its restraint can be made clear. A whisper of a beat propels an inquisition into self-doubt, longing, and regretâher voice aches, soaring with resolve before a gravitational pull brings it back down. A dreamy piano melody serves as a sidekick alongside synths that swell to a climax and then drop out altogether. It masterfully makes the ugly, complicated mess of interrogating lost love feel like an act of pride. Because when youâve aimed a spotlight at yourself, perhaps all that matters is knowing youâre worthy of its glow. âPuja Patel\n\n__Listen:__ [FKA twigs, âcellophaneâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=YkLjqFpBh84)","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"functional-tags":[{"id":"5d8930012c883100087550da","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"_opinion","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"opinion"},{"id":"5c8ec8994101df3df85c46b1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"_sensitivecontent","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sensitivecontent"}],"sections":[{"id":"5929d2bfd7a71d1ea569992f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lists & Guides","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lists-and-guides"}]},"channel":"Features","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"592604b17fd06e5349102f34","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"","name":"Pitchfork","socialMedia":[],"title":"Staff"}]},"dek":"The tracks that defined the year, starring Billie Eilish, Thom Yorke, Normani, Bad Bunny, and more","hed":"The 100 Best Songs of 2019","galleries":{},"inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2019-12-17T20:22:47.162Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5deadcc7cade48000818ec8b","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1200,"height":630,"format":"PNG","duration":null,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fcn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fpublic\u002Fpitchfork\u002Fproduction\u002F2019\u002F12\u002F06\u002F5deadcc7cade48000818ec8a_songs_final.png"},"2:1":{"override":false,"height":600,"width":1200,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":600,"width":1200,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":630,"width":1120,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":630,"width":1120,"x":40,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":630,"width":840,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":630,"width":840,"x":180,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":630,"width":630,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":630,"width":630,"x":285,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"filename":"songs_final.png","revision":0,"title":""}],"lede":[{"id":"5debe781cade48000818ecce","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":3333,"height":1667,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fcn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fpublic\u002Fpitchfork\u002Fproduction\u002F2019\u002F12\u002F07\u002F5debe781cade48000818eccd_2019_songs.jpg"},"2:1":{"override":false,"height":1666,"width":3332,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1666,"width":3332,"x":0.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":1665,"width":2960,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1665,"width":2960,"x":186.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1665,"width":2220,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1665,"width":2220,"x":556.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1667,"width":1667,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1667,"width":1667,"x":833,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"altText":"","credit":"Illustration by [Drew Litowitz](http:\u002F\u002Fdrewlitowitz.com\u002F).

But your best girlfriend? Brilliant. Showstopping. Flawless. Tove Loâs âGlad Heâs Goneâ is a hilariously insane demonstration of how far women will go to support each other. The Swedish pop star steps politely out of brunch to counsel her friend through a break-up, then treks across deserts, through hurricanes, and on top of subway cars while delivering advice. She gets arrested after casually killing a burglar, escapes from jail, and changes her identityâall the while chatting with the effortlessness of someone at home painting their nails. âCat Zhang\n\n* * *\n\n[#video: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002FQyZeJr5ppm8](620x345)\n\n### 16.\n## Aldous Harding: âThe Barrelâ\n\n### Director: Martin Sagadin and Aldous Harding\n\nWhat the hell is going on in Aldous Hardingâs video for âThe Barrelâ? Donât ask her; [she ainât telling](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002Fsections\u002Fallsongs\u002F2019\u002F02\u002F19\u002F695796657\u002Faldous-harding-talks-about-her-intriguing-new-song-and-video). Is that discomfiting stare and bizarre shimmy some kind of comment on the inherent awkwardness of human interaction? Is that enormous, condom-like hat (and the surprise connected to it) a metaphor for the ways in which we try to obscure the uglier parts of ourselves? Is that ecstatic dance at the end an expression of the freedom of letting go of inhibitions? Youâll just have to decide for yourselfâand chances are, once youâve seen âThe Barrel,â it will be a while before you stop thinking about it. âAmy Phillips\n\n* * *\n\n[#video: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002FwACSfREgJys](620x345)\n\n### 15.\n## Jenny Hval: âAccidentâ\n\n### Director: Zia Anger\n\nZia Angerâs music videos are always labors of love, full of intense performances and meticulous details, but her latest clip for frequent collaborator Jenny Hval takes this concept further. âAccidentâ stars Angerâs mother, Barbara, as she pantomimes the actions of two younger women pondering ideas of reproduction, shame, and existence. Paired with symbolic bursts of caves, jellyfish, and running faucets, the surreal video proclaims that childbirth is part of a greater system of magic, one that connects the personal with the cosmic. âQuinn Moreland\n\n* * *\n\n[#video: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002F2S24-y0Ij3Y](620x345)\n\n### 14.\n## BLACKPINK: âKill This Loveâ\n\n### Director: Hyun Seung Seo\n\nK-pop videos are known for their excess, but BLACKPINKâs \"Kill This Love\" makes most of their peersâ visuals look like chintzy cellphone clips. The abundant ideas, outfits, sets, and dance moves flash by at a pace that will leave you breathless. Jennie mugs in front of a pair of swans the size of SUVs. Lisa raps in a technicolor heaven stocked with only the sugariest cereals. Jisoo dons an artsy headpiece resembling a frozen splash of water that should make BjÃ¶rk jealous. RosÃ© speeds down a dark highway in a muscle car, crying as she bares down on... *herself*. Not to mention the climactic scene in which all four members dance in the middle of a bear trap big enough to snare a T. rex.

J. Cole]\n\n### Director: Aisultan Seitov\n\nâa lotâ is nothing like the typical 21 Savage video: Heâs not hanging out in a trap house with Metro Boomin, and there are no slow-motion shots of weapons and pricey weed. Instead, âa lotâ is about family. In the clip, the Atlanta rapper attends an opulent gathering with relatives; the overall tone is joyful, but it changes in flashback scenes that show each person at a low point in their lives. Despite all of their issues, the familyâs problems are an afterthought when they get to dance and eat lobster with the people they love. And did I mention that 21 Savage is decked out in the cleanest black suit? âAlphonse Pierre\n\n* * *\n\n[#video: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002FyjmZLaymJU8](620x345)\n\n### 12.\n## Anna Meredith: âParamourâ\n\n### Director: Ewan Jones Morris\n\nRod Stewart, miniature train zealot and recent cover model of *[Railway Modeller](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bbc.com\u002Fnews\u002Fentertainment-arts-50403561?fbclid=IwAR0F--9dalKMDt1btE6ZcwGF2BBtV7G5M_zMJpi9HKr1FmsadKnzzEviCsM)* magazine, would surely love this ingenious video from English electro-classical composer Anna Meredith. A LEGO train weaves merrily around her bandâwhizzing under legs, past the cello and tuba, under houseplant leaves and over desktop trestlesâwith the camera strapped to its front for a first-person vantage. The thrill ride is impressively synced; the rail tracks are laid out perfectly to emphasize the dynamics of the song, turning sharply at string squeals and curving gracefully during languid passages. It is a spree of lo-fi genius. âStacey Anderson\n\n* * *\n\n[#video: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002FzvAUZQxb0ME](620x345)\n\n### 11.\n## J Balvin \u002F Bad Bunny: âCUIDAO POR AHÃâ\n\n### Director: Colin Tilley\n\nWhy are J Balvin and Bad Bunny stomping around Mykonos like a gang of Hot Topic goths about to ruin an influencerâs vacation? Why are their black-clad cronies leering down from white buildings? What is that slimy lobster-bug crawling out of the sea? Terror mixes with mischief in the stylish video for âCUIDAO POR AHÃ.â Its images of J Balvin dangling upside-down over a fire and splashing blood onto a church sparked outcry over âsatanicâ imagery, but Balvin was cool onscreen and off, [retorting on Instagram](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fp\u002FB1jr1yMHq6n\u002F), âIf being satanic is to create different content and entertainment, then what am I?â âCat Zhang\n\n* * *\n\n[#video: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002F9T51n3tvZ3M](620x345)\n\n### 10.\n## Tierra Whack: âUnemployedâ\n\n### Director: Cat Solen\n\nLeave it to Tierra Whack to give âcouch potatoâ a disturbingly literal visual. The Philly rapperâs sinister one-off single âUnemployedâ laments the 9-to-5 grind, and the video depicts her as a chef toiling in a kitchen, hacking away at anthropomorphized potatoes as the other spuds look on in terror.

The Chemical Brothers seek to address these deficits in a video with a gravitas and weight the *Air Bud* films never dared approach. Fair warning to the squeamish about animal danger: Thereâs a moment in the video when it looks like a dog might die. The dog doesnât die. It becomes more powerful than any of us could possibly imagine. âEvan Minsker\n\n* * *\n\n[#video: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002FeQCpjOBJ5UQ](620x345)\n\n### 8.\n## RosalÃ­a: âFucking Money Manâ\n\n### Director: BÃ rbara FarrÃ©\n\nâFucking Money Man,â which combines clips for two RosalÃ­a songs, subverts the tropes of greedy game shows. The beat of the first song, âMilionÃ ria,â urges her on as sheâs picked from the audience to come onto a gaudy stage. She grabs at bills in a wind chamber, wins a car, and spins a mystery wheel. The card she lands on reads âDio$ No$ Libre Del Dinero,â and with that, the video flips abruptly into the second song. RosalÃ­a becomes the showâs musical guest, and within a ring of fire, she laments the destructive force of wealth. She staggers off the stage when sheâs done, disoriented after so strongly condemning our hunger for cash.

The bondage doesnât last long. Though âGoneâ appears to have a Michael Bay budget, its true power comes from the intimate chemistry between its two stars: They prowl around each other and writhe in ecstasy with unwavering eye contact. By the time the steamy visual reaches its climax, with the duo dancing on the carâs roof in a lightning storm, Charli and Chris have cut through every obstacle holding them back. âQuinn Moreland\n\n* * *\n\n[#video: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002F9ClYy0MxsU0](620x345)\n\n### 6.\n## Stormzy: âVossi Bopâ\n\n### Director: Henry Scholfield\n\nEveryone has to come harder with their flexes in 2020, because few can hope to top Stormzy shutting down London in his video for âVossi Bop.â The British rapper drifts past landmarks like the Westminster Bridge and the Bank of England, backed by a troupe of dancers draped in black. Itâs a mesmerizing video with effects thatâll make you dizzy, lavish set changes, and Stormzy relaxing on the hood of a Prius.

The video weaves a wide range of imagesâportraits celebrating black cowboy aesthetics, symmetrical poses inspired by Hindu and Buddhist mudras, webcam footageâinto a gorgeous moodboard for Solangeâs meditative lyrics. The song is one of many on *When I Get Home* named after streets in Houston; from its chopped and screwed-inspired instrumental to its lyrical references to âblack braids,â âblack skin,â and âblack faith,â it pays homage to the culture of her city. The videoâs images, filmed at Texas landmarks, flow together seamlessly: Concentric circles of people walking in a parking garage segue into concentric circles in an office room. The circular motion of a pole dancer merges into a slowly rotating motorcycle. Cinematic push-outs follow one another, creating a feeling of endlessness. âVrinda Jagota\n\n* * *\n\n[#video: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002Fqolmz4FlnZ0](620x345)\n\n### 4.\n## Lana Del Rey: âDoinâ Timeâ\n\n### Director: Rich Lee\n\nIn Lana Del Reyâs grainy visual for â[Doinâ Time](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Fnews\u002Flana-del-rey-shares-new-doin-time-video-watch\u002F)ââthe [Sublime](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Fartists\u002Fsublime\u002F) cover nobody knew they neededâjumbo Lana traipses through Los Angeles like a benevolent King Kong, plucking palm trees like daisies and sipping from rooftop water cisterns. We soon realize that these scenes are being projected at a drive-in movie theater packed with 1950s coupesâbut when one moviegoer (also played by Del Rey) catches her date smooching another woman, Lana Kong breaks the fourth wall to avenge her.

How do you put visuals to that kind of scope? This sweeping video succeeds by keeping the focus on Angel Olsen alone as the world floods and burns around her. She has a male co-star, but you never get a clear look at his face or into their relationship. You only see where it takes her: on a hillside at dawn; in a carâs headlights in the pouring rain; lost beneath a canopy of trees; deep underwater with a white dress billowing around her. Sheâs everywhere at once. Sheâs free. âSam Sodomsky\n\n* * *\n\n[#video: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002FFKXSh14svlQ](620x345)\n\n### 2.\n## Normani: âMotivationâ\n\n### Director: Dave Myers and Daniel Russell\n\nInspired by turn-of-the-millennium pop videos by Destinyâs Child, Jennifer Lopez, Ciara, and more, [Normani](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Fartists\u002Fnormani\u002F)âs clip for âMotivationâ is full of feel-good energy.

As she dances her way through classic locations from R&B videos past, including b-ball courts and street parties, her plea to âtake a look at me nowâ feels like a revelation, an undeniable starmaking turn.

She articulates the heartbreaking need to perform for each other in relationships, lilting, âDidnât I do it for you?

Storming from the stoops of Harlem to the bustling storefronts of Canal Street are the gaptooth spitfire Wiki and the languid daydreamer Hak, whose relentless banter never loses steam. Producer Sporting Lifeâs abstract, sample-heavy soundscapes conjure the chaos of the modern concrete jungleâa sound that evokes the dissonance of â70s no wave and the experimentation of â90s hip-hop. Together, Ratking paint a compelling city portrait: âRemove Yaâ addresses its rampant stop-and-frisk abuses, while the jazzy âSnow Beachâ chastises gentrification for poisoning the Big Apple. *So It Goes* shows NYC as it really is: pretty, gritty, and gross, forever restless and forever alive. âQuinn Moreland\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fratking\u002Fso-it-goes){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fso-it-goes\u002F884998023?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F58080937%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d727a650db1d10008f1fa92]|||\nL Y F|||\n\n+++\n\n### 199.\n## Wu Lyf: *Go Tell Fire to the Mountain* (2011)\n\n\nIn the late 2000s and early 2010s, plenty of indie bands sprang up with crystalline guitars, cryptic lyrics, and an aversion to sharing basic biographical details. But those other acts didnât have a singer like Wu Lyfâs Ellery Roberts. *Go Tell Fire to the Mountain* supported Robertsâ shredded growl with patient post-rock builds, and the result was pure catharsis.

The material is more wistful: Where Bushâs best singles have often been about having something beautiful that youâre about to lose, much of *50 Words for Snow* addresses things that are already lost.

Twirling grainy wisps of synthesizer around a hollow core, itâs hardly more substantial than wind chimes caught on corroded magnetic tapeâand all the more captivating for it.

But when they divorced in 2015, the breakup encouraged her to go down a darker, more existential path. Her ambitious double album *The Weight of These Wings* carries on in a grand tradition of messy relationship statements: It has the grit of Tom Pettyâs *Wildflowers* and the uncertainty of Bruce Springsteenâs *Tunnel of Love*, wrapped up in Lambertâs fiery, down-home charm. Its songs are torch ballads and highway anthems with a live band that feels borne of late night jam sessions, raw and unglamorous. For Lambert, redemption comes from buying a cheap pair of plastic sunglasses, by spending late nights alone at the bar, in knowing that she alone controls her destiny. Legend has it, she hung up on the first interviewer she spoke to about the recordâthe question was about Sheltonâs new partner, Gwen Stefaniâand decided that she would do no press surrounding the album, letting the music speak for itself. âAll you had to do was listen,â she [said](https:\u002F\u002Fpeople.com\u002Fcountry\u002Fmiranda-lambert-no-interviews-weight-of-these-wings\u002F).

He was only 18 at the top of the decade, when he and his childhood friends were dubbed the Next Great Punk Band, and across four albums and countless shows, they put in the work needed to uphold the claim. *Beyondless*, the quartetâs most recent LP, saw them once again expanding their sound in service of their ever-growing ambition, this time incorporating manic violins, honky-tonk pianos, and, for the first time, a guest vocalist in Sky Ferreira. The permanently anguished RÃ¸nnenfelt offers up a clear example of his dark philosophy in the cabaret stunner âShowtime,â narrating the onstage suicide of a handsome young singer.

Nashville singer-songwriter Sophie Allison was far from the only former home-recorder making bittersweet indie pop in 2018, but she did it her own way, and with impressive craft. Released when Allison was 20, these endlessly replayable songs have the prickly slouch of â90s indie rock, but with wide-eyed vulnerability and bright melodies in place of ironic distance; the sharp eyes and conversational delivery of vintage Taylor Swift, but with more of real lifeâs mess. Itâs tempting to dwell on just the first three tracks: the relationship dysfunction of dreamy ballad âStill Clean,â the vicarious imperturbability of swirling anthem âCool,â and, especially, the damn-she-just-did-that Stooges reversal âYour Dog.â But the rest is also revelatory; the subdued finale âWildflowers,â where Allison intones that she âfound God on Sunday morning, layinâ next to you,â is a sigh of relief that leaves you gasping for more. âMarc Hogan\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fsoccer-mommy\u002Fclean){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fclean\u002F1324319630?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F82330905%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d728f53fd34990009cf899d]|||\nBlueberry\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 183.\n## Elysia Crampton: *American Drift* (2015)\n\n\nElysia Cramptonâs experimental electronic music unearths deep personal truths in surprising places. Her earlier work as E+E turned heads by finding something sublime and alien in edits of pop hits by the likes of Justin Bieber. Cramptonâs first album under her own name, *American Drift*, is a four-song, 30-minute set bringing together crunk, trap, cumbia, spoken word, crickets, and blaring radio station identifications. *American Drift* runs deeper when you learn about the ideas that inform it: The Bolivian-American producer described the album as an investigation of her adopted home state Virginiaâs history, of brownness, of colonialism. As the bubble for mass-market electronic dance music was about to burst, this individualistic approach distinguished Crampton as a renegade on the rise. âMarc Hogan \n\n__Listen:__ [SoundCloud](https:\u002F\u002Fsoundcloud.com\u002Fblueberry-recordings\u002Fsets\u002Famerican-drift-by-elysia-crampton)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d72900f0db1d10008f1fa9c]|||\nSabotage\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 182.\n## G.L.O.S.S.: *Trans Day of Revenge* (2016)\n\n\nâT.D.O.R.â usually stands for Trans Day of Remembrance, a time to pay tribute to victims of violence in the community.

(Their acronymic name was equally bold: \"Girls Living Outside Society's Shit.\") With *Trans Day of Revenge*, G.L.O.S.S. railed against the cultural tropes that so often diminish a trans woman's life into a narrative of muted tragedy. Inflamed and incandescent, lead singer Sadie Switchblade's yowl scorches anyone who would tell her to shut up, stay docile, wait her turn. âWhen peace is just another word for death\u002FItâs our turn to give violence a chance,â she screams in the opening bars against the roar of distorted electric guitar, just before a typhoon of drums crashes in. Continuing in the riot grrrl tradition of flashing sharpened teeth at embedded patriarchal violence, G.L.O.S.S. burned bright in their brief time together, leaving behind a relic of pure and righteous anger. âSasha Geffen\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Bandcamp](https:\u002F\u002Fgirlslivingoutsidesocietysshit.bandcamp.com\u002Falbum\u002Ftrans-day-of-revenge)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7290be6eee70000829f2ba]|||\nJagjaguwar\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 181.\n## Jamila Woods: *LEGACY! LEGACY!* (2019)\n\n\nOn her second album, R&B singer Jamila Woods grapples with the present by looking to the past. Each track is an ode to one of her inspirations, most of them women of color. Sometimes she writes directly from their perspective, but more often she draws from her subjectsâ lives and adapts their words to her own life. She channels Eartha Kittâs self-assuredness, then Frida Kahloâs sense of balance in romantic relationships; Zora Neale Hurston reminds her that she is allowed to contain multitudes. Pulling from so many texts and thinkers, *LEGACY! LEGACY!* is theoretically dense, but it flows like honey.

They make bright, shiny synth-pop that is entirely self-written and self-produced, but is so immaculately constructed, it feels like it was built by a team of scientists. And yet, in 2013, *The Bones of What You Believe* served as the ideal wake-up call for those stumbling blearily out of the chillwave daze. On soaring songs like âThe Mother We Share,â âWe Sink,â and âRecover,â Lauren Mayberryâs crystalline voice deconstructs fractured relationships with beguiling poetics and brutal honesty, while the music swells with a mastery of dancefloor dynamics that nods to New Order and Depeche Mode.

Two EPs, sparse cover art, conceptual experimental musicâat first, this is all we knew. By the time *Black Up* dropped, we knew the group was led by Ishmael Butler (formerly of Digable Planets) and multi-instrumentalist Tendai Maraire, but their biographies didnât matter; they had effectively let their music do the talking. *Black Up* is drowned in murky instrumentals and bombastic, introspective rhymes. The sounds flirt with jazz, but also root themselves in a firm understanding of silence, or the sparse magic of simplicity. The songs teem with unexpected climaxes, like when âFree Press and Curlâ veers straight into gospel, or the way \"Recollections of the Wraith\" seems to wrestle with itself before settling on a rush of soaring vocals in the chorus. From great mystery exploded an album of impossible vision. âHanif Abdurraqib\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fshabazz-palaces\u002Fblack-up){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fblack-up\u002F669854622?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F6986980%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d72a6dcfd34990009cf89d5]|||\nMatador\u002FPop Noire\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 178.\n## Savages: *Silence Yourself* (2013)\n\n\nThe post-punk hero of the decade wore pink stilettos onstage and made monogamy sound as appealing as anthrax. Jehnny Beth, frontwoman of Savages, sang with a sinister and a heavy-lidded hauteur, adding omnidirectional disdain for all things patriarchal and vanilla. Below her, terse, voluble bass and severe toms also nodded back to another era, one more restrictive to women as bold as the ones in this London band.\n\nSavagesâ debut came almost secondary to their quick mythologyâtheir live show was explosive from the jump, a salve for those who missed the dark, sweaty scenes that predated them. But *Silence Yourself* carries every bit of that adrenaline; in its coiled, sparking guitars and rabid screams, it warns of the dangers of technology while weaponizing its potential. Too loudly to be ignored, it disputes complacent norms: Maybe marriage isnât idyllic, but asphyxiating. Maybe an endless stream of information isnât edifying, but toxic. And maybe a clarinet solo *does* belong in the yearâs most casually brutal rock album. Suddenly, the alternatives sounded ancient. âStacey Anderson\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fsavages\u002Fsilence-yourself){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fsilence-yourself\u002F614945667?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F19927123%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d72a75153e80c0008f43715]|||\nThird Man\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 177.\n## Margo Price: *All American Made* (2017)\n\n\nMargo Price toiled for years to become an overnight sensation: Her acclaimed debut *Midwest Farmer's Daughter*, released in 2016 on Jack White's Third Man Records, came out after she had spent more than a decade in the Nashville trenches.

He had nothing to prove. But even at 62, Scott-Heron still had his ear to the ground. On *Iâm New Here*, his 13th and final studio album before he died in 2011, he doesnât just swerve into icy, minimalist electronics for the first timeâhe, along with producer Richard Russell, uses them to bring new friction to his aching, burnished voice. Over 15 tracks of wry philosophizing and solemn reflection, Scott-Heron honors everything in his rearview, from the strong women who shaped his character to the many mistakes that cost him dearly. He seems deeply lonely at timesâa secluded insomniac whoâs seen it all and knows change is stubborn to comeâbut at times, he also sounds reinvigorated.

The German producer uses the last 20 years of electronic music as a massive sandbox from which to create textured tracks that are familiar enough to be enjoyable, yet mutate enough to constantly surprise. Album opener âCerroverbâ is built on empty space: Cosmic blips burble and then fade away abruptly, like the track is decomposing as you listen. Later, â50 Euro to Break Boostâ offers up a gritty breakbeat smeared with foggy synths that hover like a beautiful, toxic rain cloud.

Call *After Laughter* âemo for adultsâ: Williams wrote an album that feels like a perfect window into the inner turmoil that defines millennialsâ state of extended adolescence. Maybe modern Paramore feels as urgent as old Paramore did once because the confusions of young life have lingered longer than expected; maybe no one really ever grows up at all.

Most crucially, she remembers its score by John Williams, which featured a boys choir singing the Welsh lullaby âSuo Gan.â Her breakthrough album, *The Magic Place*, summons similar moments of peace amid chaos. Her primary mode of expression is her voice and a loop pedal, layered to feel completely enveloping: the reverb-coated sound of singing and breathing, echoed until you forget where itâs coming from. Arriving early in a decade that would find other young artists drawing inspiration from the once-maligned New Age genre, the album represented a shift in how the underground could embrace the celestial.

Undeniably prolific by 2014, heâd amassed a cult fanbase but most of the world didnât yet know him. *DSU*, his fifth proper album as Alex G, changed this. Self-recorded in his Philadelphia home, the characters in its 13 songs are often bleakâlovesick fatalists, regretful junkies, and self-proclaimed emotional voidsâbut in his hands, they transform into slightly haunted, subtly profound stories. His songs are built around catchy, intimate melodies evocative of Elliott Smith at his poppiest, with disorienting flourishes of freakiness, like a pitch-shifted baby voice or sharp blasts of dissonance. Insular without being inaccessible, addictive while still being idiosyncratic, *DSU* affirmed that the decadeâs most singular voices were probably holed up in their bedrooms, waiting to be heard. âQuinn Moreland\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Falex-g\u002Fdsu){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fdsu\u002F1079064127?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F56714255%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d72b7006eee70000829f2c2]|||\nCash Money\u002FYoung Money\u002FRepublic\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 166.\n## Nicki Minaj: *The Pinkprint* (2014)\n\n\nOn her third studio album, *The Pinkprint*, Nicki Minaj came closest to putting it all together: rapping and singing, EDM and hip-hop, seriousness and ridiculousness.

In âPowerful Man,â she feels guilty for catching a father beating his child and not pressing the issue with an overwhelmed teacher. Elsewhere, she sings from the perspective of the â60s folk musician [Jackson C.

Matty Healy and co. have morphed from a spunky buzz band with a few bratty, glossy singles into the act that best captures the anxious modern conditionâor, at least, has the ambition to try. The bandâs second album, *I like it when you sleep*â¦, is the moment when their skills caught up with that ambition. Instead of sticking with sleek Phoenix-esque pop-rock, the band opens themselves to a wide range of influences: the sleek pop of the â80s, neo-soul, shoegaze, and heartfelt acoustic balladry. Not every single lyric landed, but they met each clunker with a line that captured exactly what itâs like to live in this moment. Take this one at the center of âA Change of Heartâ: âYou said Iâm full of diseases, your eyes were full of regret\u002FAnd then you took a picture of your salad and put it on the internet.â That perfect balance between anguish and absurdity is what makes the 1975 feel so relevant, and so resonant. âJamieson Cox\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fthe-1975\u002Fi-like-it-when-you-sleep-for-you-are-so-beautiful-yet-so-unaware-of-it-5b689b1d-81bc-4bb6-817d-ef76d4ac84fe){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fi-like-it-when-you-sleep-for-you-are-so-beautiful-yet\u002F1440832181?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F57494415%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d94b58ea540790008f9dbb0]|||\nSelf-released\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 160.\n## Noname: *Room 25* (2018)\n\n\nNoname once quipped that her style is âlullaby rap,â in reference to her soft timbre and relaxed cadence.

The emotional intensity and velocity of their songs suggest open spaces instead of dimly lit basements, singing along over solitary headbanging. For all the misery and pain conjured by their music, played at slow speeds with infinite layers of guitars, their records can feel oddly uplifting. Some of that is due to the soaring vocals of Brett Campbell, but the real magic lies in the bandâs songwriting. Their epic song lengths become templates for dazzling melodies, classic rock choruses, and solos as memorable as the hooks. On their sophomore album, *Foundations of Burden*, Pallbearer cleaned up their sound, stripping away the murk of earlier releases. Near the end of the record is âAshes,â the atmospheric interlude thatâs a prerequisite for any serious doom metal album.

The sound is physical, designed to rattle rooms. It wasnât much like the previous music made by Derek Miller, who was in a metalcore band, or Alexis Krauss, who in her teens was part of a Cheetah Girls-ish girl group. In fact, it wasnât like much else at all.  \n \nThe newness of *Treats* lends itself to metaphors: Itâs like you took an old issue of *YM* magazine, shot it, sampled the gunshots, then wrote lyrics out of the tattered snippets about braces, illicit drugs, âdumb whores, best friends,â and beach bashes. It was pure pop as concentrate. Come 2019, *Treats* still sounds like nothing else around, but for a different reasonâunlike most pop music today, it has negative chill. (It also doesn't sound like Sleigh Bells these days, who have inevitably done a sonic pivot.) But echoes of it can be found: PC Music took the art-pop roots and a few of the soundsâthe sonar-like pings of âRun the Heart,â the *Jock Jams* synthsâand made them more candy-colored.

Am I Jim Morrison? Iâm sorry that Iâm Jim Morrison.

He is magnetic and empathetic and tender and unbearably silly, all at once and all of the time, and so is the music, which smears together Auto-Tune, orchestras, glam-rock guitars, and entire showrooms full of 1980s synths.\n\nAcross the albumâs 15 songs, Healy wants to verbalize every racing thought in your fevered brain: your boredom, your callow judgments, your sudden bouts of existential terror and your equally sudden bursts of inexplicable lust, your opinions on how whiskey tastes and the sound of your Twitter feed imprinting itself on your neural cortex.

Itâs not dissimilar to ambient music, but things that exist as atmosphere are seldom this unsettling. Together, Metro and 21 make having sex in lavish hotels with jewelry swinging against your chest sound like a completely foreign experienceânot just the price of the room or the chains, but the sensation of having things touch your neck, the unnatural feel of the bedsheets.

His comeback after abandoning Silver Jews in 2009 found him contemplating the struggles of maintaining relationships, faith, confidence, and hope as you get older. âThings have not been going well,â he announces wearily in its opening track, and the songs that follow prove this to be something of an understatement.

Case in point: His 2012 mixtape *Rich Forever*, in which the former prison guard fully embraces his villainous kingpin persona, casting himself as the hardboiled antihero of his own blockbuster action franchise. Forgoing the decadent, red-velvet soul of his studio albums, *Rich Forever* emphasizes tight, IMAX-sized instrumentals. From the searing synthesizers of âHigh Definitionâ to the brutalist, grinding trap of âYella Diamonds,â nearly every beat is as mammoth and monumental as Rossâ brontosaurus grunt. And at a time when rappers like Drake and Kendrick were prioritizing grounded, personal statements, Ross doubled down on fantasy.

After breaking through with 2012âs delightful and funny *Light Up Gold*, their follow-up album, *Sunbathing Animal*, made the band an unlikely pillar of modern American rock. The record cultivates an air of hyper-rational individuals thwarted by modern mania; its surrealist screeds transform, upon inspection, into pleas for sanity. Andrew Savage and Austin Brown emit a flurry of barely formed questions: How do you navigate the enduring challenges of love and passion amid labor exploitation, political cruelty, and the specter and spectacle of American violence? The music runs then crawls, plays dumb then flaunts frills. To hide genius hooks in songs so slack is audacious, the mark of a band either certain youâre paying attention or the complete opposite. âJazz Monroe\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fparquet-courts\u002Fsunbathing-animal-322eb9dc-c9eb-47aa-8b0e-bd6c08998ec4){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fsunbathing-animal\u002F1068020261?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F55307797%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d76a4ca6eee70000829f34f]|||\nEditions Mego\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 139.\n## Emeralds: *Does It Look Like Iâm Here?* (2010)\n\n\nWith *Does It Look Like Iâm Here?*, the experimental Ohio trio Emeralds ascended toward more melodic, starry atmospheres without losing any of the density and power of their previous sound.

That it gained such a huge following and catapulted Tame Impala into the mainstream is ironic, but not surprising. Throughout the record, classic rock tropes are updated with reverence, memorable riffs are tossed off like theyâre in endless supply, and moments of bliss allow for at least an illusion of catharsis: The tongue-in-cheek single âElephantâ is so sure of itself that it practically swaggers, while âFeels Like We Only Go Backwardsâ is built around blown-out cymbals and a communal hook that happens to be all about frontman Kevin Parkerâs own indecision and dashed hopes.

While Chicago footwork had been percolating for over 20 years at the time of the compilationâs release, for many people outside the local scene, it proved to be their first experience of the genreâs marriage of breakneck beats with haunting soul samples. Alongside searing examples of the form by pioneers like RP Boo and DJ Rashad, who would go on to take footwork around the world, thereâs a DJ Nate track that verges on the spiritual, and a succinct meditation on loving support by Tha Pope. A decade on, *Bangs and Works* still sounds as fresh and invigorating as the first listen. âRuth Saxelby\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fbangs-works-vol-1-a-chicago-footwork-compilation\u002F687501131?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F22979365%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d76ae9d6eee70000829f356]|||\nXL\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 128.\n## Radiohead: *A Moon Shaped Pool* (2016)\n\n\nWhen *A Moon Shaped Pool* entered the world in May 2016, many of the horrors Radiohead had spent more than two decades warning us about were coming to fruition. Campaigns for Brexit and Trump were spreading odious strains of nationalism. The Earthâs temperature was reaching precipitous new highs. Nefarious companies were harvesting data from tens of millions of Facebook users in order to undermine American democracy. The record also arrived amid acute personal tragedy for Thom Yorke, who had announced a separation from his partner, Rachel Owen, the year prior. (Seven months after its release, Owen died following a long battle with cancer.) Itâs no wonder that, [according to one scientific analysis](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.rcharlie.com\u002Fpost\u002Ffitter-happier\u002F#analysis), *A Moon Shaped Pool* was found to be the infamously bleak bandâs most depressing album.\n\nAnd yet the record does not wallow. The stubbornly forward-facing quintet allows itself to look backâmost notably with âTrue Love Waits,â a live fan favorite since the mid â90s, finally put to tape in the studioâwhile avoiding self-parody or indulgence. On the luminous ballad âDaydreaming,â Yorke sounds like heâs levitating when he sings, âWe are just happy to serve... you.â Itâs a nod to the symbiotic bond Radiohead keeps with their listeners through the worst of times, a bond that this album elegantly upholds. âRyan Dombal\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fradiohead\u002Fa-moon-shaped-pool){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fa-moon-shaped-pool\u002F1111577743?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F60215409%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d76af692073fe00084eb238]|||\nMatador\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 127.\n## Car Seat Headrest: *Teens of Denial* (2016)\n\n\nLike his indie rock forefathers in the Replacements, Car Seat Headrest mastermind Will Toledo sounds sincerely undecided about embarking on any kind of grand search for purpose.

They ripped into entrenched notions about its sound and audience, then stood back to admire the glorious mess. Still, the producer-singerâs opposing musical textures cohere astonishingly well: R&B grooves meld into sinister spoken-word interludes, sensuous cellos and militaristic chopper sounds share space. Bowie tugs at the ear with teases of pop before abruptly morphing into something far more severe. They often invert foreground and background, retreating to near-tuneless vocal melodies that act more as scaffolding than centerpiece within their heady brew of electronics. Amid the tumult, *Safe in the Hands of Love* examines the tension between being held, being confined, and the rare instances where the two conditions meet. The album itself occupies a similarly strange intersection: It is both remarkably beautiful and remarkably unnerving. âOlivia Horn\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fyves-tumor\u002Fsafe-in-the-hands-of-love){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fsafe-in-the-hands-of-love\u002F1429971639?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F94625862%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d76b10f9ce93e000838225f]|||\nDomino\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 124.\n## Real Estate: *Days* (2011)\n\n\nThere are albums on this list excavated from the darkest pits of despair, ones that irrevocably reshaped the sound of pop, and ones that will be commemorated by future generations as crucial documents of the decadeâs political turmoil. And then thereâs Real Estateâs second album, *Days,* which people turned to when they wanted something that just sounded good. If that seems like damning praise, consider how hard it can be to face the challenge of substantiating serenity, of finding validation for the ambient sadness and fleeting joys that make up most of life, of appreciating the past without being trapped in it. With this album, Real Estate casually perfected a novel form of crisp, interlocking jangle that couldâve been sourced from any point in the last 35 years. *Days*â most enduring image is a pair of names carved into a treeâfitting for an album that will always be right where you left it, exactly how you remember it. âIan Cohen\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fdays\u002F470027419?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F37002536%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d76b1746eee70000829f38c]|||\nDeathwish\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 123.\n## Deafheaven: *Sunbather* (2013)\n\n\nSinger George Clarke and guitarist Kerry McCoy recorded their first demos as Deafheaven while living with 12 other people in an old nunnery in San Franciscoâs Mission District, their call-center jobs barely lucrative enough to cover a combined $500 in rent. Listening to the opening notes of their sophomore album, you canât help but get the sense that they are trying to escape: Clarke screams like a man in fear for his own life as the songâs frenzied guitar tremolos and ragged blast-beats sound like they are trying to outrun each other. To the chagrin of black metal and hardcore purists, Deafheaven also seemed determined to evade any distinctions between one brand of wall-of-sound catharsis and another, teetering endlessly between ecstatic chaos and the melodic romance of â90s shoegaze and post-rock. But focusing on *Sunbather*âs surface prettiness ignores the sheer scale of its compositional ambition, its brocaded sonic sub-plots and gut-punching crescendos channeling the go-for-broke ambition of people with nothing to lose. âEmilie Friedlander\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fsunbather\u002F652038965?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F20749616%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d76b1c00db1d10008f1fb65]|||\nMatador\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 122.\n## Snail Mail: *Lush* (2018)\n\n\nHow does *Lush* manage to sound so radiant?

It is a profound work that addresses a manâs end, and what he must let go of once he gets there. Cohenâs legendary baritone is leagues deeper than before, perhaps sunk by the weight of his subject matter. On the title track, he sounds as though heâs been living off a steady diet of cigars and scotch; his grumbles are foreboding, even sinister, against the synagogue choir that echoes him.\n\nCohenâs repetition of the word âhineni,â Hebrew for âhere I am,â is one of the recordâs most chilling momentsâhis humble surrender to a greater power. *You Want It Darker* is full of these concessions: he sings of relinquishing life, love, and libido throughout its sparse yet rich compositions. His ability to examine mortality with such restraint is a testament to his elevated craftâwhen he sings of letting go and traveling light, itâs with relief. âMadison Bloom\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fleonard-cohen\u002Fyou-want-it-darker){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fyou-want-it-darker\u002F1154144036?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F66024823%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d76b5289ce93e0008382261]|||\nEpic\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 117.\n## Death Grips: *The Money Store* (2012)\n\n\nThat ringing sensation in your head from the crossed streams of cable news and political discourse?

Japandroids spend the next 35 minutes doing whatever they can to delay the moment when the highest of highs must give way to the cruelest of comedowns. The Vancouver duoâs second album condenses all the promise, excess, and regret of an epic all-nighter into an eight-song dusk-to-dawn cycle, like a *Dazed and Confused* that swaps out bored teens in the â70s for directionless twenty-somethings in the 21st century. Nostalgia hits like a panic attack, the line between motivational anthem and break-up song gets blurry, and even the most starry-eyed declarations of devotion come embedded with escape clauses for when the thrill is gone. Back in 2009, Japandroids introduced themselves to the world by declaring âYoung Hearts Spark Fire.â On *Celebration Rock*, their relentless effort to keep the flame alive only made them more conscious of the shortening wick.

It showed. In rejection of the frictionless EDM sounds then at their commercial peak, Daft Punk went straight to the source in their quest to revive some of their favorite analog styles. They booked time in a handful of the worldâs most renowned studios to record the disco pioneer Nile Rodgers, several hall-of-fame session musicians, and vocalists including Pharrell and Panda Bear, then painstakingly pieced together their work into songs that span poppy funk, prog, new wave, soft-rock balladry, and even spoken word (courtesy of electro godhead Giorgio Moroder). As a whole, the album plays like an eclectic radio transmission beamed in from an imagined past.\n\nThe highlight remains âTouch,â a psychedelic showstopper sung by â70s songwriter Paul Williams, best known for his work with Barbara Streisand and the Carpenters. At one point in the intricately arranged song, a space-age choir gives way to Williamsâ voiceâdelicate yet firmâbacked by nothing but a grand piano. âSweet touch, youâve almost convinced me Iâm real,â he muses, a mouthpiece for the mysterious duo who remind us just how tangible music can be. âNoah Yoo\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fdaft-punk\u002Frandom-access-memories){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Frandom-access-memories\u002F617154241?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F20115556%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d77ae489ce93e0008382347]|||\nSoutterain Transmissions\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 111.\n## EMA: *Past Life Martyred Saints* (2011)\n\n\nConfessional songwriting in the 2010s had a tendency toward extremesâyou had your empowerment narratives, where struggles were introduced and then brushed aside to allow time to wallow in the fabulous now, and you had your nihilistic tales of pill-popping self-hatred. *Past Life Martyred Saints*, the debut album by Erika Andersonâs project EMA, lives in the complicated middle, a place where the pain is very real but so is the occasional flicker of hope.\n\nOver blues-scuffed alt-rock, Andersonâs characters pull up their sleeves to reveal open wounds and fading scars and speak of an emptiness that makes them want to vomit, but deep down they also believe that someone out there might love them. Later in the decade, Anderson would turn her eye to the political and cultural forces that drive people toward darkness, but *Past Life* is far too claustrophobic for that kind of perspective.

Nevertheless, Holterâs search for meaning in âdestitute timesâ translates to an unmistakably contemporary record, her stream-of-consciousness lyrics gesturing bleakly at the nightly news (âFrequent missile talk\u002FSlurping on the words I heard from the wretched zone\u002FFortune throwing candy slow in a death crawlâ).

Blending soul, hip-hop, house, jazz, and disco, and featuring vocal turns from the likes of Vic Mensa, Syd, Craig David, Anderson .Paak, and more, the album is also a reaction against the relative whiteness of EDM circa 2016. For all the acrobatic weaving of glitchy beats with slinky, complex instrumentation, it never feels anything but warm; the athleticism isnât necessarily beside the point, but itâs not meant to make a spectacle of itself, either. Moreover, the album is a benchmark for how pop music has commonly come to be thought of in this decade: If you blend enough genres together, they cancel each other out, and whatâs left is just its own thing that doesnât have any particular use for a tidy classification. âSteve Kandell\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fkaytranada\u002F99-9){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002F99-9\u002F1092026376?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F59881207%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d77b9160db1d10008f1fc75]|||\nDomino\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 107.\n## Dirty Projectors: *Swing Lo Magellan* (2012)\n\n\nDirty Projectors used to be an inscrutable band.

But on *Swing Lo Magellan*, their formal experimentation slowly gave way to an emotional generosity no amount of musical theory could obfuscate.\n\nThe album shines with the warmth and familiarity of a group of loved ones trading stories around a campfire. Itâs unguarded, with âImpregnable Questionâ offering itself as a premier wedding song for former hipsters experimenting with sincerity.

It is cotton-soft and canyon-wide, as crisp and ornate as frost forming on the window. A similar coldnessâthe absence of loveâinforms his spare, beautiful debut album, *Aromanticism*. It is not a lament for lost love but a guess that love may never arrive. His brand of blues is heavy with emotion, even as he wonders if he might not want to feel any of it. Maybe heâll call you back; instead of sex, how about just a little making out in the car?

The brothers, who started DJing as teenagers in southeast England, may have relied on familiar formulas with *Settle*, but they still managed to fashion them into one of the most irresistibly inviting dance records of the decade. The duo supported their carefully curated patchwork of genres with a wide net of guest artists, many of whom turned into quick success stories themselves: the duo single-handedly launched Sam Smithâs career with the bombastic âLatch,â and the Nottingham pop group London Grammar began climbing after their slow-burning turn on âHelp Me Lose My Mind.â Disclosure wouldnât scale the same heights again, but *Settle* remains a vivid, ecstatic time capsule of early-2010s club music at its pinnacle. âEric Torres\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fsettle-deluxe-version\u002F1440862011?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Fartist%252F3900791%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d77bad853e80c0008f43887]|||\nDon Giovanni\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 104.\n## Waxahatchee: *Cerulean Salt* (2013)\n\n\nAllison and Katie Crutchfieldâs scrappy teenage band P.S.

After the twin sisters broke up the group in 2011, Allison stepped out from behind the drums to lead the noisy guitar-pop band Swearinâ; Katie holed up at their parentsâ home with an acoustic guitar and recorded her debut as Waxahatchee, the stark, searing *American Weekend*. Its follow-up, *Cerulean Salt*, focused all that accelerated musical experience and added new color. Katie still recorded at home, but now âhomeâ was a Philadelphia house she shared with Allison and her Swearinâ bandmates, who pitched in across the album. Backed by thudding drums and blown-out guitars, Katieâs heartrendingly vivid sketches of alienation and self-doubt sound almost triumphant, especially on the surf-flecked âCoast to Coast,â where she insists, in her faint drawl, âIâll try to embrace the lows.â After this, Waxahatchee jumped labels to indie titans Merge, releasing two more remarkable albums and continuing to inspire a generation of acolytes to sing their own messy truths. âMarc Hogan\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fwaxahatchee\u002Fcerulean-salt-clear-vinyl){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fcerulean-salt\u002F785719208?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F25060605%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d77bb550db1d10008f1fc77]|||\nRVNG Intl.\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 103.\n## Helado Negro: *This Is How You Smile* (2019)\n\n\nRoberto Carlos Lange had been building toward *This Is How You Smile* for over a decade.

He reached a creative apex on *This Is How You Smile* by washing his sound in tape hiss and soft-lit synths, casting a twilight glow over bilingual meditations on community, displacement, and loving the skin in which you were born.

Take *Late Nights*, an album that represents a triumph within the major-label system for its mere existence. Singles âPlanezâ and âOuiâ became rap and R&B radio mainstays purely off the strength of the songwriting; Jeremih otherwise declined to engage in any sort of promotional tactics, from shooting music videos to performing on television. In touring the album, he immediately clashed with headliner PARTYNEXTDOORâtop-billed despite having far fewer hitsâbefore being accused of sending out a body double at a show in Houston.\n\nWhile a dominant musical theme of the 2010s was the seamless fusion of rap and R&B, as employed by artists like Drake and Post Malone, Jeremih got to the same place from the other side; his R&B flows and flexes like rap music, but with a distinct melodic bounce that could only come from a singer. The music on *Late Nights* rates as some of the finest R&B of the decade, even if that genre tag fits loosely: Highlights âPass Datâ and âDrankâ are experimental celebrations of substances that travel along pathways carved by Lil Wayne and Young Thug, and ballads like âActinâ Upâ and âRemember Meâ have a stoned spaciness that recalls the decadeâs best hip-hop. The albumâs most instructive song is âParadise,â a gentle acoustic outro that begins with Jeremih still high from the night before, a girl next to him in bed, and ends with him alone in a jacuzzi toasting his great life. You get the sense he enjoys the solitude. âJordan Sargent\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Flate-nights\u002F1440859822?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F54275547%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d77bc32fd34990009cf8be5]|||\nItalians Do It Better\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 101.\n## Chromatics: *Kill for Love* (2012)\n\n\nWhen shadowy studio rat Johnny Jewel cofounded the Italians Do It Better label in 2006, his music as part of reformed noise-rockers Chromatics cast him as an artist wonderfully out of time with his surroundings. But when Chromaticsâ fourth album *Kill for Love* was released in 2012, the timing couldnât have been more perfect: Jewel's nocturnal aesthetic had just served as the primary sonic influence for Nicolas Winding Refn's stylish hit film *Drive*. *Kill for Love* is a pitch-perfect and impeccably post-genre blend of Italo discoâs slow-motion thump, the self-mythologizing of classic rock, and smeared-lens ambient synth workouts.

In 2017, 22 people were killed in a suicide bombing at her concert in Manchester. For most people after that, just getting out of bed would be an accomplishment. But Grande, with immeasurable strength, managed not only to throw off the covers but to return to center stage with *Sweetener*. The path from trauma to sunny pop affirmations isnât a straight one, but she walked it with grace and poise. Pharrell, who co-wrote and produced much of the album, evokes his early-â00s heyday with bouncing, hectic beats, while Grande uses her big voice to both mourn and celebrate. The devastating âno tears left to cryâ could have been too sentimental in someone elseâs hands; in Grandeâs, itâs an anthem.

The Puerto Rican singer and rapper was exactly the right personâyoung, outrÃ©, extraordinarily talented, experimentalâat the exact right time, spreading Soundcloud singles through word-of-mouth until he was eventually the purveyor of his own nuevo religiÃ³n. *X 100PRE*âinternet wordplay for âpor siempre,â a self-estimation of his musical longevityâwas a thrilling exploration of his range, hitting on the Latin trap wave he helped captain, but also diving into dembow, yearning ballads, clubby reggaetÃ³n, and delightfully feisty emo.\n\nBad Bunnyâs unwillingness to conform to the rigid masculine scripts that often inform mÃºsica urbanaâhis nail polish and acrylic extensions just the tip of itâinforms the freedom of his music, and *X 100PRE* was a brilliant musical rebuttal to that rigidity. Throughout, his deep, demonstrative care for his community is tempered by an equal capacity for personal bluster and self-regard. (Or, as he raps on the banger âCaro,â âYo sÃ© cuÃ¡nto valgoâ: âI know how much I'm worth.â) Though lite reggaetÃ³n and its offshoots continue to break through to English-speaking audiences and climb charts in the States, Bad Bunnyâs debut is most important as a rejoinder to his masses of young Spanish-speaking fans: This is their world now, and his, and theyâve earned it. âJulianne Escobedo Shepherd\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fbad-bunny\u002Fx-100pre){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fx-100pre\u002F1447554595?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F101423934%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d77fc496eee70000829f4ac]|||\nOlsen\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 98.\n## Todd Terje: *Itâs Album Time* (2014)\n\n\nThe title of Norwegian nÃ¼-disco master Todd Terjeâs only full-length record to date is a joking acknowledgement that all hyped DJ\u002Fproducers inevitably make the leap from 12-inches and edits to âseriousâ album statements. Terje approaches this common rite of passage as a truly special once-in-a-lifetime eventâone that demands dressing up in your finest evening attire and cracking open that bottle of bubbly in the back of your fridge. You donât so much listen to *Itâs Album Time* as step into its cosmic cocktail-lounge fantasia. Like a proper host, Terje sets the perfect pace for the eveningâs indulgences, laying out the tantalizing hors dâoeuvres (the frothy space-funk trifles that comprise the recordâs opening suite) before serving the main course (the hedonistic electro-house pleasures of âStrandbarâ and âDelorean Dynamiteâ). In his effort to reshape the DJ\u002Fartist album template in his own eccentric image, Terje canât help but indulge in one cliche of the form: the rock-star cameo. But in this case, itâs hardly a calculated crossover attempt: by enlisting Bryan Ferry for a moody, minimalist reading of Robert Palmerâs 1980 new wave nugget âJohnny and Mary,â Terje provides both a well-timed respite from the albumâs relentless revelry and a sympathetic portrait of the lost souls most in need of it. âStuart Berman\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Ftodd-terje\u002Fit-s-album-time){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fits-album-time\u002F806267243?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F25990423%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d77fcc12073fe00084eb386]|||\nSecretly Canadian\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 97.\n## The War on Drugs: *Lost in the Dream* (2014)\n\n\nOn *Lost in the Dream*, the War on Drugsâ third album and first masterpiece, highlights like âAn Ocean Between the Wavesâ and âRed Eyesâ pivot on simple pleasures: a slow build, a well-timed â*woo!*â But bandleader Adam Granducielâs production is meticulously layered, occasionally fading into pure ambience and letting his dark textures tell the bigger story.

Upping the ante, *Contra* took its title from Nicaraguaâs CIA-backed right-wing paramilitariesâa witty inversion of The Clashâs *Sandinista!*, named in tribute to that countryâs socialist government. *Contra* amplifies and exacerbates all the aspects of Vampire Weekend that trad indie rock fans associated with *la contrarrevoluciÃ³n:* the dainty details, the blithe bounciness, the preppy smartness, the clever-clever references. Polishing the debutâs demo-like sound, *Contra* set its sights on the charts. Drum machines merge with hand-played rhythms, digital reverb lends a slightly canned quality to proceedings, and, on the mad sprint of âCalifornia English,â Ezra Koenigâs already buttery voice is buffed to a slick Auto-Tune sheen.\n\nWhat *Contra* does share with *Sandinista!* is the later Clashâs outward-facing perspective and yen for border-crossing hybridity. The instrumental arsenal includes rebolo, zabumba, and shereke, and no, I donât know what those are either. But these exotic borrowings read less like rhythms-of-resistance solidarity and more like liberal-elite tourism. What does it all add up to? Whose side are Vampire Weekend on anyway?

Itâs also the casual intimacy of her delivery: the way the London artist extends each word of the chorus of âFine Againâ into a line long enough to wrap around a shoulder. The non-verbal vocal wriggles on âAffection.â The chin jut and soft warning of âGo Now.â Many of the songs use improvised first-take vocals, which is a testament to Tirzahâs friendship with the composer and musician Mica Levi, who crafted the albumâs spacious beats and introspective piano refrains. In taking care to value in-the-moment feeling over post-production polish, *Devotion* achieves the feat of being a truly idiosyncratic pop record that itâs easy to feel at home with, too. âRuth Saxelby\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Ftirzah\u002Fdevotion){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fdevotion\u002F1372735578?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F92654764%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7802ccfd34990009cf8c01]|||\nRoc Nation\u002FDef Jam\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 92.\n## JAY-Z \u002F Kanye West: *Watch the Throne* (2011)\n\n\nUpon its release in 2011, JAY-Z and Kanye West's self-celebrating team-up *Watch the Throne* drew blowback for its [Maybach-destroying](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=BoEKWtgJQAU) extravagance in the wake of the global financial crisis. Neither rapper has ever been one to apologize for pushing the boundaries of good taste, though, and the gilded album had the substance to back up its vanity.

In between infamous lines about planking on stacks of cash and marrying the Olsen twins are thoughts on gang violence in Westâs native Chicago and hymns that invoke Martin and Malcolm.

After all, Justin Vernonâs time in the studio with Kanye West gave him plenty of exposure to Auto-Tune and other digital technologies, and that hypermodern signature positions *22, A Million* about a billion miles from the modest, earthy tones of the bandâs first two albums. But what ultimately makes the Wisconsin groupâs 2016 album so striking has less to do with production choices than sheer chutzpah. Thereâs an unabashedly gonzo energy to the album, from its yin and yang symbols and yodeling-adjacent vocal leaps to its typographically deranged track titles that look cribbed from a witch house mixtape.

Instead, he figured the reception of that album meant that people liked what he was doing. For its follow-up, the former mathematician moved even further away from the cerebral, opening his heart and giving us a batch of body-moving love songs.  \n \nThe lyrics donât look like much, but they operate as mantras. âCanât Do Without Youâ is a tenderizing phrase; by the time the songâs done, Snaithâs pledge that âyouâre the only one thing I think aboutâ comes across as heartbreakingly sincere. The effect is similar on âOur Loveâ as bass fills in the silence, suggesting the beating of multiple hearts. It isnât always so easy, as the minor-key melody and lyrics of âBack Homeâ suggest.

It is this juxtaposition between the edifying and the primal that makes Hvalâs albums so thrilling, and *Apocalypse, girl* is her crowning achievement to dateâa generous record that explores big feminist questions and childhood fever dreams alike while flitting among eerie ambient sounds, lounge-lizard folk, and one-woman Gregorian chants. With its bongo-laden smirking about womenâs strides meaning Hval can âconsume what I want now,â âThat Battle Is Overâ is an immediate standout, but the looser tracks detailing Christian dedication and early psychosexual thoughts show off Hvalâs entrancing voice and reveal their brilliance more gradually.

Whether itâs the sudden tape-warp of âJacquelyn in the Background,â the self-harmonies of âBack, Baby,â or Prattâs sometimes-affected voice, *On Your Own Love Again* creates a space for itself that seems to change with the quality of the light. âJesse Jarnow\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fjessica-pratt\u002Fon-your-own-love-again){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fon-your-own-love-again\u002F936872257?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F86403862%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d78122553e80c0008f43912]|||\nSelf-released\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 84.\n## Chance the Rapper: *Acid Rap* (2013)\n\n\nThe already-vanishing difference between a mixtape and an albumâfrom a rap listenerâs perspective, at leastâevaporated completely in the 2010s, and no one took advantage more enthusiastically than Chance the Rapper. The Chicago MC was barely 20 years old when he started giving away what was technically his second mixtape, *Acid Rap*, for free online, but it instantly felt like a classic *album*. He had already shown promise on his first tape, 2012âs intricate *10 Day*, but *Acid Rap* raised the stakes to giddy new heights. Chanceâs cartoonish squawk veers unpredictably between cigarette-burnt sing-song and âtobacco-packinâ acrobatâ rapping. He manages to project off-kilter exuberance even as heâs haunted by the same gun violence as his Chicago drill-rap contemporaries. And heâs assisted by an improbable yet satisfying guest list that includes hometown speed-rapper Twista, like-minded genre-bender Childish Gambino, and a rising Noname. With *Acid Rap*, he earned his stardom. âMarc Hogan\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Facid-rap\u002F1470464025?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F112262593%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7812be8699b30008f1acf8]|||\nHyperdub\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 83.\n## Burial: *Rival Dealer* EP (2013)\n\n\nWilliam Bevan (a.k.a.

Rival Dealer serves as the climax to a three-EP streak of genius, beginning with *Kindred* and *Truant\u002FRough Sleeper*. The title track opens with a melody resembling a scream, cooling into gentler vocals and softer beats before opening up into a gorgeous major-key pool of light. âHidersâ steers into near-schmaltzy euphoria, while the closing track, âCome Down to Us,â samples an inspirational speech by Lana Wachowski about âother worlds previously unimaginable.â Burialâs music has been caricatured for his moodiness, but *Rival Dealer* proved that his music serves a higher purpose. âJo Livingstone\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Frival-dealer-ep\u002F893730102?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F31939786%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7814e42073fe00084eb3c0]|||\nTrue Panther\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 82.\n## Girls: *Father, Son, Holy Ghost* (2011)\n\n\nAfter releasing their promising indie-pop debut two years earlier, Girls thoroughly redefined themselves on their second and final album, *Father, Son, Holy Ghost*. Now, Christopher Owens and JR Whiteâs homespun project was a vehicle for opulent, laser show-worthy â70s classic rock. But their record also further illuminated the wounded emotional core embedded within frontman Owensâ lovable fuck-up persona. The albumâs devastating centerpiece, âForgiveness,â takes the form of an eight-minute confession-booth visitation in which he begs for mutual absolution from all heâs wronged and all whoâve wronged himâand when this hushed acoustic hymn erupts into a squealing guitar solo, itâs less a gratuitous display of fretboard fireworks than a physical manifestation of the immense effort and pain it takes to overcome past traumas. Just a year after releasing this record, Girls were no more, and the news of their sudden demise came as a shock to many fans. But in hindsight, we shouldnât have been so surprised: *Father, Son, Holy Ghost* is a pristine portrait of a band that did everything they wanted to do and said everything that needed to be said. âStuart Berman\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Ffather-son-holy-ghost-bonus-track-version\u002F453540055?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F58086307%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d78154f0db1d10008f1fcf2]|||\nColumbia\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 81.\n## Solange: *When I Get Home* (2019)\n\n\nOn the *When I Get Home* interlude âCan I Hold the Mic,â Solange makes a case for honoring all the different parts of yourself. âI canât be a singular expression of myself, thereâs too many parts, too many spacesâ¦â she says, trailing off in thought, like this list could go on for eons. The idea of the infinite existing within the singular is a running theme throughout the albumâespecially when she sings about her hometown of Houston, a city that contains multitudes.

To enjoy it is to luxuriate in perfectly executed fundamentals of composition: the resolution of a chord progression, the precise arrangement of percussion that transforms a straight beat into a syncopated one, the discernible shape of a melody that drifts and changes without losing its essential character. And while the music comes from many sourcesâtechno, house, ambient, and various branches of electropop are always present, in ever-shifting proportionsâyou get the sense that this particular arrangement of sounds, with its rhythmic quirks and signature tuneful flourishes, could only come from one person. After the shock of hearing new music from Richard D. James subsidedâreleased with little warning, *Syro* was the first new Aphex Twin album in 13 yearsâwe had time to appreciate that this was one of his very best records, which is to say that itâs one of the best instrumental electronic records ever made. âMark Richardson\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Faphex-twin\u002Fsyro){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fsyro\u002F911319255?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F34298496%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d794c1c53e80c0008f439c4]|||\nInterscope\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 79.\n## Tame Impala: *Currents* (2015)\n\n\nWith *[Currents](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Freviews\u002Falbums\u002F20578-currents\u002F)*, [Tame Impala](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Fartists\u002F28673-tame-impala\u002F)âs Kevin Parker abandoned the more resolutely lo-fi aesthetics of his first two albums, like a film director transitioning from Super 8 to IMAX.

Fresh from collaborations with the iconic percussionist Steve Reid and in an arguable creative peak in his career, Hebden harnessed the thrill of these surroundings to create a tribute to musicâs transportive power, its ability to make you feel so chemically blissed-out that the stresses of life fall away. He even plants the seeds of his own autobiographical joy, amplifying the literal heartbeat of his godson and recording a friendâs kid playing a toy piano.

But what if the future, full of computerized voices and digitized avatars, allows us freedom from restrictive contemporary notions of gender and sexuality? On her debut album, the Scottish producer SOPHIEâs plastic, glinting experimental pop dares to imagine a time when weâll have agency over our bodies and identities. On âFaceshopping,â she finds realness in the seductions of Photoshop, and on âImmaterial,â vocalist Cecile Believe gleefully chants, âI can be anything I want.â While the album is lyrically abstract, it is also SOPHIEâs most vulnerable project; before she released the music video for âItâs Okay to Cry,â few listeners had ever seen the elusive producerâs face. SOPHIE build a whole new world, one where our most authentic selves are the ones we construct, reinvent, and debut to the world every day. âVrinda Jagota\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fsophie\u002Foil-of-every-pearl-s-un-insides){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Foil-of-every-pearls-un-insides\u002F1396580720?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F90144193%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d794ea24bc6510008699745]|||\nAtlantic\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 73.\n## Cardi B: *Invasion of Privacy* (2018)\n\n\nFrom the moment Cardi B started rapping for money, she wanted to be the shrewdest in the game, even if she wasnât the technical best.

Her music was sensitive and hardcore, carefully crafted, and, most of all, likable. The bass on âI Like It\" seemed made to blow out speakers on any continent, and âBe Carefulâ was Cardi's rap version of a quiet storm anthem. Her once unrefined flowâa subject of ridiculeâwas more sculpted, even next to agile guests like Migos, Chance the Rapper, and SZA. It was a seamless debut, made better by the fact that it wasnât supposed to be this good. âClover Hope\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fcardi-b\u002Finvasion-of-privacy){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Finvasion-of-privacy\u002F1368156323?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F86900549%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d794f374bc6510008699747]|||\nSub Pop\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 72.\n## Father John Misty: *I Love You, Honeybear* (2015)\n\n\nBefore he became notorious for trolling journalists and engaging in performance art about What It All Means, Josh Tillman captured the feeling of love as a defiant, selfish, and contradictory state of emotions on *I Love You, Honeybear*.

So for her first album in eight years, Robyn skipped floor-filling pop anthems in favor of the tender electro-pop therapy we didnât know we needed, meeting real-life heartbreak and loss first with mourning, then with acceptance and celebration. Taking her time meant Robyn came to the table with deep reflection, scripting effortless-seeming phrasesââturned all my sorrow into glass,â âweâre making diamondsââthat froze transient emotion in amber. Sheâs both the subject and the sympathetic ear, playfully poking holes between her personal and artistic identities on âSend to Robin Immediately,â and issuing a collective invitation to *party, party, par-ty* on âBeach 2K20.â More than any one standout song, *Honey* is a mood and a balm, an equilibrium as light and steady as its beachy house beats. But perhaps the best moment is the transcendent closer âEver Again,â a plea for peaceââHow âbout we stop arguing and do something else?ââsealed with the promise that no matter how long you wait, real honey never spoils. âAnna Gaca\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Frobyn\u002Fhoney){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fhoney\u002F1436781118?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F96970803%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7950a24bc6510008699749]|||\nMatador\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 70.\n## Perfume Genius: *No Shape* (2017)\n\n\n*No Shape*, the fourth album from Mike Hadreasâ avant-pop outfit [Perfume Genius](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Fartists\u002F28685-perfume-genius\u002F), is a rapturous ode to true love that spares no bell, whistle, or baroque string section.

Still, he is just as quick to be vulnerable: On âDie 4 You,â his voice retreats to the trembling timbre of Sade. On the closing ballad âAlan,â written for his boyfriend and longtime collaborator Alan Wyffels, Hadreas is equally delicate, though his proclamations are less lofty. âDid you notice,â he sings, in recognition of a small and simple kind of love, âwe sleep through the night?â âMadison Bloom\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fperfume-genius\u002Fno-shape){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fno-shape\u002F1210458504?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F73299504%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7a566f256a0a000948334f]|||\nCash Money\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 69.\n## Drake: *If Youâre Reading This, Itâs Too Late* (2015)\n\n\n*If Youâre Reading This Itâs Too Late* captures rapâs biggest star in self-congratulation, celebrating his ascent to sovereignty and already on the defensive as a result.

Fusing jazz, video-game sounds, post-Dilla hip-hop, IDM drum breaks, laser shrieks, and much more, he forged a fluid and propulsive music that doesnât have a name. He made *Cosmogramma* while his mother was dying, so he sampled the sound of her hospital-room machinery on âGalaxy in Janaki,â the albumâs hypnotic final track. Elsewhere, he processes the weight of his musical heritage: the recurring joyful soul melodies recall âLove Hangover,â written by Ellisonâs grandmother Marilyn McLeod, and mournful jazz-harp interludes reference Ellisonâs great-aunt, Alice Coltrane. Live instrumentation and guest vocals from Ravi Coltrane and Thom Yorke send ambient melodies drifting over steady grooves and skittish beats.

Her songs unfurl at a stream-of-consciousness pace, narrating the mundanities of daily life over garage-rock guitar. She sings about about the benefits of owning a percolator, the burnout of office workers, and even, at one point, restlessly declares mid-song that she might be hungry. But the poetic attention Barnett pays to everyday experiences belie her greater anxieties beneath the free-wheeling music: a tour of a sad house on âDeprestonâ tells a story of death and regrowth; a walk on the beach in âKimâs Caravanâ leads to a meditation on destroyed coral reefs. With *Sometimes I Sit and Think*, Barnett became a poster woman for a young generation seized by self-doubt and introversion, and her music never failed to process those feelings with a dark sense of humor. âHazel Cills\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fcourtney-barnett\u002Fsometimes-i-sit-and-think-and-sometimes-i-just-sit){: rel=nofollow} | \n[Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fsometimes-i-sit-and-think-and-sometimes-i-just-sit\u002F960342539?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F82575082%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7a5aed0db1d10008f1ffc9]|||\nRabid\u002FMute\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 66.\n## Fever Ray: *Plunge* (2017)\n\n\nKarin Dreijer's 2009 self-titled debut as Fever Ray was about motherhood, but motherhood portrayed via a near-unbroken stretch of anhedonic sludge: postpartum depression as an album. So it was a surprise to many when, upon revisiting their solo project nearly a decade later, Dreijer inverted it entirely to release a playful, gleeful album primarily about queer desire and kink.

The love songs have a frantic glee and the kink is as much about sentiment as sex. The political songs are personal (and delivered the iconic lyric âthis country makes it hard to fuck!â). The most *Fever Ray*-esque track, âMustn't Hurry,â is about wanting to leave that albumâs gloom behind to get to the good part: âSaw the blood,â Dreijer sings, âbut it's not scary.â âKatherine St. Asaph\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Ffever-ray\u002Fplunge){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fplunge\u002F1299148287?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F80236343%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7a5baa4bc65100086997f3]|||\nEpic\u002FFreebandz\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 65.\n## Future: *Dirty Sprite 2*  (2015)\n\n\nFutureâs consistency works to his disadvantage; his relentless stream of albums and mixtapes this decade can feel like a level plane. *Dirty Sprite 2* is manifestly some kind of peak, though, in quality and mainstream impact. The album works as a microcosm of Futureâs career: fixated in themes and mood, a steady accumulation of dirge upon dirge sustaining his bleak vision of joyless hedonism. It could be ambient music, almost, if the beatsâmostly by Metro Boominâdidnât hit with such pummeling physicality.\n\nMemorable images flash up now and then: the codeine urine of âThought It Was a Drought,â the literal money-laundering of âBlood on the Money.â But Future is not a lyrical MC in the tradition upheld today by Kendrick Lamar. Heâs a voice more than a writer, who shines as texture rather than text, and his most crucial accomplice was the late engineer Seth Firkins, the Auto-Tune wizard who coated Futureâs bleary croon in a hundred subtle shades of digital grit. A plateau of pleasure-pain, *DS2* finally breaks loose with the closer âF*ck Up Some Commasâ: an anthem of ecstatic indifference, Future squandering money and life-force over Southside & DJ Spinzâs slow-mo stampede.

A classically trained composer who began her career recording piano ballads, Mitski insists that her music is technical rather than emotional, the characters in her stories fictional rather than autobiographical. *Be the Cowboy*, her fifth album, is a stunning piece of theater on the subject of wanting. Whether sheâs spinning pain into something danceable on âNobodyâ or pushing away a devoted loverâs touch on the searing âA Pearl,â the stories Mitski tells may be imaginary but the emotions are real. As she expands her sound, swapping her signature guitar shredding for synthesizers and disco, assuming the voices of weary wives and swaggering conquerors, Mitskiâs songs are the most complex theyâve ever been. âHazel Cills\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fmitski\u002Fbe-the-cowboy){: rel=nofollow} | [Vinyl Me, Please](https:\u002F\u002Fvinyl-me-please.evyy.net\u002FkGo3z){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fbe-the-cowboy\u002F1373892692?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F91826107%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7a5e6f0db1d10008f20001]|||\nFoolâs Gold\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 63.\n## Danny Brown: *XXX* (2011)\n\n\nWhen he broke through in 2011, Danny Brown seemed to be running backwards at us, howling from about five years into the future.

She built *Arca* around her singing voice, its ragged edges tracing stories of death, and yearning, and change. If *Xen* and its 2015 follow-up, *Mutant,* flourished in cerebral space, then *Arca* aims straight for the beautiful tumult of the body.

His second album as King Krule, *The OOZ*, sees little of note on those streets, but constructs an elaborate microcosm in Marshallâs bedroom, where decay is a kind of comfort. After releasing a series of experimental songs under various monikers, he conceived *The OOZ* as a return to âguitar music.â But Marshall sets a new benchmark for the form, conjuring an odyssey of overdosed psych, anxious hip-hop, zombified punk, spoken word, loping jazz, and sound art. Vignettes flit by, conjuring heartbreak and depression; the expensive, isolating city backdrops his existential funk. Yet the immersive production and poetry reach out to you, like panicked arms from a murky deep end.

When the saxophonist Kamasi Washington released his first album for a label in 2015 after a few self-released starts, he was 34 and unusually ready for the spotlight. Heâd had the time, space, and resources to develop an uncanny fluidity among his band members, whoâd known one another since high school; they benefited from years of church and R&B gigs, and the encouragement of a network of local elders and heroes. They werenât academic formalists or bebop sticklers; they knew the canon, but grew up geographically close both to the grooves of Compton hip-hop and the commercial, proggy, and spiritual branches of jazz embodied by Patrice Rushen, George Duke, and Alice Coltrane.\n\nThis mixture of thingsâand its beneficial distance from New Yorkâgives *The Epic* its casual hugeness. Washington's playing, informed by Kenny Garrett and Pharoah Sanders, comes out in agile, darting climbs toward free-jazz wail, then slow elegies, and then clipped, mellow funk. The band includes two drummers, two bassists, a choir, and strings; it is thundering and chill, monolithic and uncontrived. It began one of the strongest groundswells in the last quarter-century of the jazz tradition, if you want to call it that. And if you do, consider that jazz has accommodated popular and sacred and advanced musicianshipâthe academic and the vernacularâsince it began. âBen Ratliff\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fkamasi-washington\u002Fthe-epic){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fthe-epic\u002F975772107?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F75215973%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7a63a8256a0a0009483358]|||\nTop Dawg\u002FAftermath\u002FInterscope\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 57.\n## Kendrick Lamar: *DAMN.* (2017)\n\n\nKendrick Lamar uses inner conflict as the main fuel source for *DAMN.*, an autobiographical work of epic proportions that won him a Pulitzer Prize.

Clarkâs father went to prison for stock fraud in 2010, which gave rise to *Strange Mercy*âs elliptical lyrics that often allude to depression, crime, and anger. But she used the incident as lighter fluid for apoplectic guitar shredding and dark tales of complicated power dynamics, whether between a dominant and submissive, a police officer and a civilian, or a parent and a child. *Strange Mercy* fuses the cinematic thrust of Clarkâs 2009 album *Actor* with stirring experimental accents, from the corrosive solo that caps âNorthern Lightsâ to the wiry motif that runs through the exquisite pop workout âCruel.â She would go on to throw bolder shapes, but with its quicksilver moods and mercurial instrumentation, *Strange Mercy* is the most urgent and resonant St. Vincent album to date. âEric Torres\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fst-vincent\u002Fstrange-mercy){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fstrange-mercy\u002F453456287?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F7748181%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7a66336eee70000829f720]|||\n300\u002FAtlantic\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 54.\n## Young Thug: *Barter 6* (2015)\n\n\nYoung Thug went from the face of rapâs inter-generational wars to one of its elder statesmen with unsettling speed.

Although the release was attended by some high-profile drama (the name was an obvious, if inscrutable, subliminal aimed at his former idol Lil Wayne), Thug sounds inordinately focused, easily out-rapping guests like T.I., Boosie BadAzz, and Young Dolph, all of whom deliver memorable turns on songs like the creeping âCanât Tellâ and the stormy âNever Had It.â Heâs remained prolific since then but, following plenty of leaks, label drama, and personal setbacks, Thug has yet to recapture the purity of that moment. âRawiya Kameir\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fbarter-6\u002F986011611?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F44632346%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7a67038699b30008f1aeae]|||\nPlanet Mu\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 53.\n## Jlin: *Black Origami* (2017)\n\n\nIndiana footwork innovator Jerrilynn Patton, aka Jlin, once said that âthe literature for experimental music is blank pages.â Her steely second album is a testament to this out-of-box thinking.

Working with collaborators like Dev Hynes and Rostam, Jepsen honed her reference points and packed the album with tactile sonic details: the synth sheen cascading off âAll That,â a ballad seemingly made for the prom scene in a John Hughes movie, or the way the house-tinged sleeper âWarm Bloodâ pulses on at least four different levels at once.

But inside the minutiae are truths that exist independently of Elverum. Itâs impossible to listen and not think about the people around you. His story starts to feel like yours.\n\n*Crow* is like a letter from an old friend that you savor alone and then put back in the drawer when youâre finished, a work designed to cycle in and out of peopleâs lives. âWe are all always so close to not existing at all,â Elverum sings in âSwims.â When that thought is close at hand, so is this record. âMark Richardson\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fmount-eerie\u002Fa-crow-looked-at-me){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fa-crow-looked-at-me\u002F1193426815?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F69145056%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7bc6760db1d10008f200c7]|||\nEpic\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 44.\n## A Tribe Called Quest: *We got it from Here...

This whirlwind of emotions can be felt in the frantic and urgent music itself, which explores exit strategies and considerations for a newer and better world in the first two songs alone, âThe Space Programâ and âWe the Peopleâ¦.â The record was released at the tail end of the week that Donald Trump was elected president, but its pitch-perfect intersection of fury and sadness had been brewing for years, which meant it arrived as a perfect response to people who assumed America had only recently become violent and frightening. Beyond all of this, the album momentarily returned Phife Dawg to us, his voice showing no rust despite the years. This is the albumâs truest gift; his instantly classic verse on âBlack Spasmodicâ feels like the MC kicking in the door to a dark room where everyone is sleeping and turning all of the lights on. âHanif Abdurraqib\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fa-tribe-called-quest\u002Fwe-got-it-from-here-thank-you-4-your-service){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fwe-got-it-from-here-thank-you-4-your-service\u002F1173106678?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F66961064%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7bccb66eee70000829f85c]|||\nCapitol\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 43.\n## Sky Ferreira: *Night Time, My Time* (2013)\n\n\nDespite the desires of her label, Sky Ferreira refused to be molded into the next coy pop princess.

Sheâs a starry-eyed romantic on âBoysâ and a scorned lover on âYouâre Not the One;â she takes accountability for her reputation on âI Blame Myselfâ and questions her relevance on the title track. Working alongside producers including Ariel Rechtshaid and Justin Raisen, she fashions these raw sentiments into sparkly synth-pop and grungy, kohl-lined gems. âNobody asked me if I was okayâ¦Nobody asked me what I wanted,â she murmurs throatily at one point. *Night Time, My Time* is testament to the power of singing for oneself. âQuinn Moreland\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fsky-ferreira\u002Fnight-time-my-time-green){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fnight-time-my-time\u002F1443133185?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F35218343%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7bcd3d53e80c0008f43b28]|||\nMotown\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 42.\n## Erykah Badu: *New Amerykah Part Two: Return of the Ankh* (2010)\n\n\nThen, now, and forever, love makes people go a little crazy. Even Erykah Badu, goddess of unbothered R&B, is not immune. Throughout *Return of the Ankh*, her only proper album of this decade, she offers up conflicting desires with the unfiltered realness of a drunk dial. She pines for a long-distance love with lusty teenage angst. She laughs about fucking around on a besotten boyfriend. She cautions would-be suitors on a song called âFall in Love (Your Funeral),â which works in lines from Biggie Smallsâ cold-blooded classic âWarning.â At one point, her frustrations make her contemplate gunplay.\n\nBut for every moment of blind passion here, there is an equal and opposite moment of contemplation: On the psychedelic 10-minute suite âOut My Mind, Just in Time,â she evolves from a doting, codependent lover to a solo superhero in tune with her own worth. The arrangements, largely based on the comforting grooves of â70s soul, add an element of analog time travel to her cosmic funk. Though a record all about the vagaries of the heart may not be a new idea, in Erykah Baduâs hands, it never gets old. âRyan Dombal\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fnew-amerykah-pt-2-return-of-the-ankh\u002F1440764608?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F3545865%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7bceb78699b30008f1b037]|||\nColumbia\u002FParkwood\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 41.\n## BeyoncÃ©: *Lemonade* (2016)\n\n\nThe first thing *Lemonade* delivers is wrath: Infidelity has ruptured not just marriage but a whole life. BeyoncÃ©, the worldâs most powerful woman, is gleeful to set streets on fire, throw off her wedding ring, shit-talk with her girls to abandon. If *Lemonade*âs first 10 minutes has a headline, it would be that Jay-Z, dummy that he is, really did cheat. But then everything builds to something more profound, more complete: a prayer about how love can fracture the self. Suddenly weâre in Texas, in stadiums, on plantations; a Led Zeppelin beat is next to a reggae sample. âSpottieOttieDopalisciousâ appears next to a James Blake feature.\n\n*Lemonade* feels like an exercise in dissonance, the act of holding two warring ideas in your head and in your heart: You can love someone but also hate them, adore your father and also resent him, want to cry and twerk at the same time. One woman can feel all of thisâand moreâat once, *Lemonade* suggests, because thatâs how confusing life and grief and history is. It exalts the mundane as profoundly spiritual: being black, being a woman, feeling confused, feeling grief, trying to forgive, feeling sexual. In all those, together, is the healing. âHunter Harris\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fbeyonce\u002Flemonade){: rel=nofollow} | [Vinyl Me, Please](https:\u002F\u002Fvinyl-me-please.evyy.net\u002FMdaR3){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Flemonade\u002F1460430561?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F108043414%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7bcfcd0db1d10008f200ca]|||\nAsylum\u002FAtlantic\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 40.\n## Charli XCX: *Pop 2* (2017)\n\n\nAfter cowriting and appearing on Iggy Azaleaâs hit âFancy,â Charli XCX could have easily shipped out to Los Angeles to record Max Martin cast-offs forever. But instead, Charli began to construct her own little weird pop utopia from the ground up, turning to the squelchy, hyper-synthetic sounds of producers like A.G. Cook and SOPHIE. The *Pop 2* mixtape, Charliâs best full-length to date, is the brilliant culmination of all that effort: a nonstop avant-garde party built for fembots and fog machines. Over the sound of her hissed âXCXâ and âItâs Charli, babyâ signatures, she pulls in multiple collaborators on each track, like the filth-loving rapper CupcakKe and the rising dance princess Kim Petras.

As the flare rises, the man can see everything. When it comes back down, it sets his boat on fire. The boat goes downâthe man, too, in all his contradictions.

Coming after more than a dozen albums, *Apocalypse* feels like an ascendance: His voice is lower, his music more rustic but more psychedelic, too.

From its daring music to its perfect title, from its stunning artwork to its startling videos, *Blackstar* was a magnificent farewell to his audience. Even the timing was immaculate, the album coming out two days before Bowieâs death. As popâs greatest self-dramatist, he doubtless felt he owed his audience a consummate denouement, but you also get the sense from *Blackstar* that Bowie felt free of obligations, able to explore and experiment to his artâs content. Unlike his preceding album *The Next Day*, *Blackstar* betrays zero concern for radio play or other worldly metrics of success. The cutting edges dominate, with a palette steeped in lifelong loves like jazz and brief passions like drum ânâ bass. But although the urgent desire to break new ground rather than revisit familiar pathways is palpable, flickers from Bowieâs vast past appear: the harmonica texture from *Low*âs âA New Career in a New Town,â for instance, rematerializes on the closing âI Canât Give Everything Away.â That title is Bowie affirming the value of mystique. Itâs notable that he never wrote a memoirâa rare act of superstar tact.\n\nYet while *Blackstar*âs words are oblique, vocally and emotionally, Bowie has rarely seemed more achingly exposed. The title track is one of the strangest and strongest things Bowie ever made. The glassy-grey waver of his voice sounds like heâs already a ghost. The refrain âIâm a blackstarâ serves as a chilling image for the extinction of personality, but also hints at the way icons fascinate long after theyâve faded from the scene, just like black holes emit radiation.  âSimon Reynolds\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fdavid-bowie\u002Fblackstar){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fblackstar\u002F1059043043?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F55825380%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7becb0bf029700081d7c3f]|||\nSony\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 36.\n## RosalÃ­a: *El Mal Querer* (2018)\n\n\nMelding classic flamenco techniques with trap and the stylistic instincts of the Instagram generation was postmodern, to say the least. And *El Mal Querer*, the Spanish virtuoso RosalÃ­aâs debut album, also highlighted a very 2010s tension between cultural appreciation and appropriation, given the Catalan singerâs pop take on the storied gitano genre and, more complexly, her adoption of an Andalusian accentâtwo hallmarks of the [Roma](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pri.org\u002Fstories\u002F2018-11-14\u002Faward-winning-rosal-flamenco-fame-questioned-spains-roma-community) people in Spain. A lesser musician might not have weathered  the criticismsâshe still seems to be figuring it outâbut *El Mal Querer* was one of the most exquisite albums of the decade. RosalÃ­aâs conservatory-trained voice is elevated by her epic album concept based on a 13th-century novel. Her interpolation of the textâs eternally human themes into todayâs hyper-tech landscape, with glitchy and romantic production courtesy of El Guincho, meant that it translated widely.

His tracks with Solange and Sky Ferreira established a new sound in pop, merging slinky guitar with full-on lamentation and heartbreak. These bummer jams, spiked with extra catchy catharsis, succeeded because they felt *real*, but Hynes had yet to fully capitalize on his talents as a solo artist. That changed with *Cupid Deluxe*. Leadoff track âChamakayâ serves as a mission statement of sorts, with Hynes using all his tricks at once: women harmonizing, echoed percussion, romantic pleading, gurgling bass. The album follows a similar kitchen-sink-funk feel, as Hynes pilfers the best bits from disco, soul, and R&B, creating a hybrid sound that's inimitable and vastly appealing. At times, a breathy saxophone wafts in from nowhere, as if things werenât sexy enough. After *Cupid Deluxe*, Hynes further opened his sound: His subsequent albums are deeper, more complex, and more adventurous. But they never sounded as undeniably funky. âMatthew Schnipper\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fblood-orange\u002Fcupid-deluxe){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fcupid-deluxe\u002F716767448?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F23673561%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7bf0c28699b30008f1b03f]|||\nDef Jam\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 34.\n## Vince Staples: *Summertime â06* (2015)\n\n\nVince Staplesâ debut for Def Jam doesnât fit neatly into any Los Angeles rap traditionâitâs not radical, just cold and alien, as if the north side of Long Beach were a quasi-industrial hell.

Moving away from the often harrowing autobiographical material of 2017âs *Capacity*, Lenker sings of metaphysical states and UFO friends, motley menageries of dogs, fruit bats, silkworms, and moths. There are fewer certainties in her lyrics than ever beforeâis âOpen Desertâ about swimming or dying?âexcept for the truest certainties of all: the knowledge that all things are connected, death is lifeâs lone constant, and a glimpse of the infinite can be found in a trick of light on water or a whispered vocal harmonized just so. âPhilip Sherburne\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fbig-thief\u002Fu-f-o-f){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fu-f-o-f\u002F1452026004?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F108003200%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7bf1a50db1d10008f200d2]|||\nJagjaguwar\u002F4AD\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 32.\n## Bon Iver: *Bon Iver* (2011)\n\n\nWith Bon Iverâs second, self-titled album, Justin Vernon leapt from his cabin in the woods into a world entirely of his own imagination. The sweeping compositions were a huge shift from his debut *For Emma, Forever Ago*âs spare folk, with arrangements that sounded like they bloomed directly from Vernonâs subconscious. Precise in imagery but hazy in structure, the songs evoke places and moments the way Vernon remembers them: unreliably and romantically.

The superstarâs aptly named fourth album marked a return to hardcore R&B after 2008âs dispiritingly middle-of-the-road *I Am...Sasha Fierce*; itâs telling that nothing here cracked the Top 10 pop chart but several songs ran up the R&B\u002FHip-Hop chart. BeyoncÃ© was done catering to visions of how her music should sound. The star power she enlisted was massiveâKanye and AndrÃ© 3000 cameoed, The-Dream and Tricky Stewart lent their songwriting chops (most notably on the perfect torch song â1+1â). And then there was a young Frank Ocean, who co-wrote the silken âI Miss You,â a song so powerful the demo allegedly [made BeyoncÃ© cry.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2012\u002F07\u002F08\u002Farts\u002Fmusic\u002Ffrank-oceans-channel-orange.html)\n\nBut ultimately the marquee star of *4* was BeyoncÃ©âs indefatigable work ethic. She turned in 72 songs for this project; 12 made the cut of the standard release. (On that note: Stick with *4*âs [original sequencing](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002F4_(Beyonc%C3%A9_album)#Track_listing)âthe reconfigured tracklist on Spotify snuffs its slow burn and displaces âCountdownâ from the climax position.)

Hurt still radiates from its pores, but so does the sound of struggle. Here, Mitski is experiencing a *second* coming-of-age, a metamorphosis from young woman into adult. She is grappling with how the world sees her and who she wants to be in it. On âMy Bodyâs Made of Crushed Little Stars,â she articulates the many mundane and not-so-mundane thoughts tumbling around her brain at any moment, pivoting from her fear of death to anxiety over an upcoming interview. On âThursday Girl,â she sounds lost in existential angst as she searches for someone to âplease tell me no.â And on the album centerpiece âYour Best American Girl,â she struggles with a lingering sense of shame about her upbringing and what it means to feel fully American and fully worthy of love. As always, Mitski is tremendously talented at working through her feelings, but on *Puberty 2*, the exhilaration comes not from catharsis, but from marinating in emotional conflict. âVrinda Jagota\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fmitski\u002Fpuberty-2){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fpuberty-2\u002F1087128495?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F60757035%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7bf44a8699b30008f1b043]|||\n4AD\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 29.\n## Deerhunter: *Halcyon Digest* (2010)\n\n\nOn their fifth album, Deerhunter linger in the dark recesses of the mind. Understated and insular, especially compared to the bandâs previous avant-garde leanings, these songs shine a light on private pains: melancholy, rejection, repression. And yet many of *Halcyon Digest*âs bleakest moments are also its brightest, which is in itself a statement on how difficult memories can shift into something more manageable. Full of lush textures and impressionistic details like âa dirty couch in the gray fogâ and âthe smell of loose-leaf joints on jeans,â *Halcyon Digest* watches memories get blown away by the sands of time yet never quite makes peace with mortality. Pushing forward this sense of impermanence, the closing track âHe Would Have Laughed,â a seven-and-half minute tribute to the late rocker Jay Reatard, cuts out suddenly in the middle of a dreamy melody, a candle extinguished as quickly as life itself. âQuinn Moreland\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fdeerhunter\u002Fhalcyon-digest){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fhalcyon-digest\u002F387922299?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F4489494%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7a863e0db1d10008f20007]|||\nYoung Turks\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 28.\n## FKA twigs: *LP1* (2014)\n\n\nFKA twigs is already so fully developed as an artist that her voiceâwispy, breathy, disarmingly operaticâcan sometimes be overshadowed by her astonishing performances. They function as demonstrations of her dancerâs command of her body, living art installations, and full-spectrum auditory experienceâtogether, something like live 4DX. *LP1*, her first full-length, alluded to the expansive visionary she'd soon become, twisting her nimble voice over a textured palette of glitchy beats and sweeping synths.\n\n*LP1* often sounds mournful, upended by her propensity for minor keys, and a notion of sexuality that was widely ascribed to its songs that [may not have been explicitly about sex](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Ffeatures\u002Finterview\u002F9460-fka-twigs\u002F). This interpretation may have been partly because of how twigs carries herselfâa generously candid musician and sinewy dancerâbut is also attributable to the complex ways she delves into such topics as autonomy, aloneness, and sensuality in a holistic sense. Lead single \"Two Weeks\" may have been a break-up song lyrically, but the way she dives into itâvocal cadences interplaying with triple-time bassâelevates it into something like a triumphant prose poem to herself. Released in a crowded year for British experimental electronics, twigs' sense of drama pushed the landscape of heady dancefloor tracks into a blissfully corporeal space. âJulianne Escobedo Shepherd\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Flp1\u002F911606990?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F58912478%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7bf55a0db1d10008f200d4]|||\nColumbia\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 27.\n## Earl Sweatshirt: *Some Rap Songs* (2018)\n\n\nAt the start of the decade, when he emerged as Odd Futureâs most gifted rapper, Earl Sweatshirt laced his intricate verses with outrageous lines about masturbation and hating Steve Harvey. But after branching off from the collective, he grew into the role of jazz poet, with an expanded circle of friends influencing him.

Now the folkier corners of indie rock are filled with auteur singer-songwriters who are trying to be both timeless and out of time, intimate-seeming yet often fleshed out by a smoky full band, angsty like punk and sad like old country. Thatâs largely her influence.\n\nOlsenâs turning point came as a result of her imagining a new way forward, both in terms of the albumâs richer instrumentation and within its narrative arc. Spurred by a breakup but ultimately about much more, *Burn Your Fire for No Witness* is self-help by way of total emotional whiplash. At her most optimistic, Olsenâs words serve as tiny mantras for fledgling twenty-somethings, the sort of poetic phrases a millennial might tattoo on their body. Employing the albumâs signature light-dark imagery, she writes her way straight out of a creative rut on âLights Outâ: âJust when you thought you would turn all your lights out, it shines,â she croons, a cool edge to her voice. A lesser singer would have delivered the line with more earnest hope, but Olsen knows that lurking behind every step forward is a dark night of the soul waiting to strike. âJillian Mapes\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fangel-olsen\u002Fburn-your-fire-for-no-witness-c4a7021b-d9d4-4b4d-8bc4-df687197c1c3){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fburn-your-fire-for-no-witness-deluxe-edition\u002F919520252?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F35535784%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7bf74a6eee70000829f8c6]|||\nYoung Turks\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 25.\n## Jamie xx: *In Colour* (2015)\n\n\nHearing *In Colour* feels like listening to the dissection of a heartbeatâskittering anxieties mirrored in the snares, the warm glow of love reflected in steel drums, camaraderie sampled via musical voices of the past.\n\nBy the time the record came out in 2015, Jamie Smith had already made two LPs with the xx, remixed an album by the legendary musician and poet Gil Scott-Heron (later loaning a sample from the project to Drake for a Top 10 hit), and released a solo track called âAll Under One Roof Ravingâ about the communal ethos of the UK underground. He was a dance music enthusiast who didnât really enjoy drugs, a loner who frequented Londonâs famous Plastic People nightclub by himself, a kid who watched UK garage documentaries on tour when he was homesick. *In Colour* was the result of his self-directed club education, a collection of influencesââ90s jungle, swaggy doo-wop, the exaltation of trance, and the tension of two-stepâthat were reverent of the past but wary of nostalgia.

It couldâve been a movie but instead, itâs a collection of songs that have the hyper-specificity of a group chat. Her experiencesâand her listenersââare all here: bad jobs, stoned Netflix binges, time-sharing men, late-night tacos, and being horny, sad, elated, messy, self-destructive, self-sufficient. She sings with pathos in every creak of her voice, catharsis in every sigh. Sheâs emotionally generous and wise, an Erykah Badu for people who spend entirely too much time on dating apps.\n\nSZA packages up all of these feelings into an album thatâs deceptively musically and technically masterful. She takes R&B to unexpected places, with composition so eccentric it becomes inimitable (as anyone who has tried to belt along her vocal runs knows). It took her a long time to release *CTRL*âderailed by label politics, three totally different versions existed before this one emerged. Because of that, maybe, the album is such an accurate soundscape of the false starts, rough drafts, and dashed expectations of growing out of your twenties. âAllison P.

There are pangs of anxiety, tooâfear that the glow will fade, or that faraway family will slip out of reachâbut they only make Musgravesâ bliss more believable, and the satisfaction sweeter. âOlivia Horn\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fkacey-musgraves\u002Fgolden-hour){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fgolden-hour\u002F1440918116?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F86330313%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d790b2cfd34990009cf8d12]|||\nMerge\u002FDead Oceans\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 22.\n## Destroyer: *Kaputt* (2011)\n\n\nDan Bejar made a masterpiece out of a comedown, a glassy-eyed look at a world starting to collapse. The dyspeptic indie rock of Destroyerâs past is smoothed with soft-rock saxophones and New Age synths, topped by Bejarâs louche vocals (recorded as he laid supine on a couch). The atmosphere was so lazy that Bejar could hardly be bothered to bring his tongue to his teeth to voice a âthâ sound; as a result, he exquisitely âsummed sroo the books on your shelf.â\n\nUnderneath the listless arrangements, Bejar settles into his bon vivant character. Heâs musicâs Oscar Wilde, staring up at the stars from the gutter while rattling off his favorite UK music mags and âchasing cocaine through the back rooms of the world all night.â The mood all drains into the final track, âBay of Pigs (Detail),â a 11-minute monologue delivered from a dock to the ocean. Tossed-off epiphanies (âthe worldâs just bonesâ) swirl into big thoughts and little memories. Underneath Bejarâs prose lurks the tides of death, love, and some great or terrible occasion just on the horizon. âAs apocalypses go thatâs pretty good, sh-la-la, wouldnât you say?â he sings, careless and preoccupied. Nero fiddled; Bejar chilled. âJeremy D.

On their first two records, that atmosphere was one of lo-fi wistfulness, but on *Teen Dream*, the Baltimore duo amplified their dream pop to the logical next step: grandiose, sweeping songs that are more My Bloody Valentine than Mazzy Star. Itâs the sound of a band pulling back the veil of composure and unleashing the emotional intensity that has long been bubbling beneath the surface. *Teen Dream* is less an ode to adolescent nostalgia as it is a tribute to a lost feeling of passion: With Alex Scallyâs guitar swelling to imperial heights and Victoria Legrandâs voice reaching new depths, euphoria bursts from every note. As Legrand chants âit is happening againâ on âSilver Soul,â the urgency of her voice commands you to hold on tight to this rapture for as long as you can, because losing it would be devastating. âQuinn Moreland\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fbeach-house\u002Fteen-dream-9ea23969-cffe-4ec1-9b00-efe7a0045259){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fteen-dream\u002F349535407?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F35091034%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d712907f1e8ce0008b7182d]|||\nHyperdub\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 20.\n## DJ Rashad: *Double Cup* (2013)\n\n\nDJ Rashad was a singular genius and one of footworkâs architects, who shared credit for this unselfishly with other members of his inimitable Teklife crew.

It melts the long history of Chicago house into the glossiest bits of pop-rap, the athletic feats of juke into the warmth and soul of the cityâs R&B. It has all the jaggedness of something stitched together by hand but none of the attendant imperfections. It moans and whimpers and bludgeons and exhales, all in perfect time.

In between, she takes on wide-lens topicsâclimate change, gun violence, depression, deathâwith effortless cool. (She even manages to seamlessly fit in a Sublime cover.) Her indelible pop melodies are strung together with the grace of a tragic ballet. Lana worked on the record with Jack Antonoff, a producer known for encouraging pop artists to indulge their most theatrical, bombastic sides. Del Rey, however, encourages a more somber atmosphere, defined by muted piano, acoustic guitars, and layered harmonies that pair with her angsty, existential storiesââ70s in spirit and â90s in frame of mind, to paraphrase a lyric. If Lanaâs music once sounded like a collage of her heroesâ greatest hits, then here is where she lapsed into her own language entirely. âSam Sodomsky\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Flana-del-rey\u002Fnfr){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fnorman-f-g-rockwell\u002F1474669063?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F116099819%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d8901df1f868e00096102c2]|||\nAftermath\u002FInterscope\u002FTop Dawg\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 18.\n## Kendrick Lamar: *good kid, m.A.A.d. city* (2012)\n\n\nOn his major-label debut, Kendrick Lamar rapped like heâd been holding a breath his whole life, and when he exhaled, everything came out: his troubled and reverent relationship to West Coast gangsta rap; the horrors and comforts of his adolescence; his mother and father, and Uncle Tony, whom he watched get shot at a burger stand; walking back from Bible study and gang-banging; the nameless souls who died asking only that Kendrick sing about them.

Among the most beautiful ballads in her catalog, âBaby Birchâ pairs her harp with electric guitar to stark, almost confessional effect; itâs the rare Newsom composition that could be drawn from the traditional American songbook.\n\nAs the follow-up to 2006âs wildly ambitious *Ys*, even just the barroom title of *Have One on Me* seems to signal a more earthbound turn from a harpist who often composes with a full orchestra in mind. But through these songs, Newsomâs greatest asset remains the cosmic grandeur she brings to even the most familiar scenes. âYou give love a little shove and it becomes terror,â she sings on âSoft as Chalk,â a quiet warning from a songwriter known to dissect the simplest truths until they turn mystical and strange. âSam Sodomsky\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fhave-one-on-me\u002F354800970?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F86403168%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d702a3413ff690008c6eeed]|||\nDef Jam\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 15.\n## Kanye West: *Yeezus* (2013)\n\n\nItâs hard to listen to *Yeezus* and not think of its caustic opening squelch as the definitive moment when New Kanye was born. As that gurgly, disorienting sound pulses and convulses for 15 seconds, it feels like a laser is cutting a hole through spacetime. Kanye emerges from this portal as confident as ever, but he sounds angrier, uglier. His rapping is crude and labored; the rhymes are vulgar and the images are incendiary. Soulâthe fulcrum of his past music, in design and affectâis supplanted by bitter, horny electricity. It feels as if Skynet sent a Terminator back in time exclusively to hip-thrust and shout obscenities in the town square.\n\nIn 2013, the theater of Kanye scorching his public image was already a familiar show, but *Yeezus* felt like a plot twist because of its intensity. From the writing to the producing to the mixing, Kanye and his corps of writers and producers insist on provocation. The lyrics repurpose loaded terms like âgod,â âslave,â and âapartheidâ for relationship drama and petty screeds. Stripped down by executive producer Rick Rubin, the sound bed is just as bristling: the low-end hits like a tsunami, verses spazz into glitchy screams, wormholes to the chipmunk soul of Old Kanye materialize then blip out, digital effects swirl and explode like fireworks. The combination of these constant spasms and Kanyeâs aggrandizement make the record feel like a toxic rager, but look closely and thereâs a grace to its motion, an elegance to its seizures. The house, industrial, and drill influences he draws from are brandished as weapons but put to use as tools, sanding all this rage into music that is as slick as it is prickly.

She took risks and freed herself from mainstream pop expectations, cementing herself as a risk-taking, boundary-breaking godhead. Her eighth album moves from jarring, atonal rock to lackadaisical dancehall before switching up into sultry, sex-positive R&B. She bounces into a stoned torch song in which sheâs all but crooning on top of a piano before, whiplash: a weird but brilliantly faithful cover of Tame Impalaâs âNew Person, Same Old Mistakes,â just because she can. Every left turn is delivered with her inimitable attitude and empowerment; every shrugged decision leads to a fascinating new journey.\n\nUpon *ANTI*âs release, *the New York Times* called it the ârecord you make when you donât need to sell recordsâ but, really, itâs the album Rihanna made when she no longer had to sell Rihanna. When it was released, she was enjoying the most freedom yet in her career: Sheâd been through her Saturn return, sheâd swerved Drake, sheâd jumped from Def Jam to Roc Nation and started her own imprint there. Sheâd acquired the masters of all the songs sheâd recorded at Def Jam and was fully independent. She was ennobled to take a big, ambitious swing that could have broken at the seams, yet *ANTI* proved her modern rewriting of that old adage: Freedomâs just another word for no fucks left to give. âAllison P.

By her own estimation, pop is âmusic that seeks to hit the pleasure center,â and *Art Angels*, replete with surging dance beats and saccharine girl-gang vocals, undeniably fits the bill. But on Claire Boucherâs fourth album, her pleasure comes cut with danger. Shrieks and snarls burn holes through the aptly named âSCREAM;â in one [distinctive visual](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Tv9YoYCKNoE), she knifes herself and smears blood across her face; on âCalifornia,â a lyric about âcommodifying all the painâ points to the sinister capitalist underpinnings of the entire pop enterprise. Along with mussing up popâs slick surface with a generous coating of gore, on *Art Angels,* Boucher conspicuously styles herself as an auteur, challenging the notion that popâs frontwomen are seen but not really heard without a cadre of industry men behind them. If such women are the product of a âpop star mold,â Grimes has left that mold noticeably warped. âOlivia Horn\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fgrimes\u002Fart-angels){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fart-angels\u002F1051022913?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F53699960%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d89085ed118d20008aff3df]|||\nDef Jam\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 10.\n## Frank Ocean: *Channel Orange* (2012)\n\n\nChristopher Breaux began the decade as a recent transplant to Los Angeles whoâd written a few minor songs for Justin Bieber and Brandy. He will end it as Frank Ocean, not just one of the most acclaimed musicians of his time but a trailblazer for artistsâ autonomy and their freedom to express their sexuality. His legacy on the former was secured when he delivered one album to Def Jam and sold another immediately to Apple. The latter came years earlier when he published an open letter on Tumblr in which he came out as queer, one of the first men in R&B and rap to do so. But the album that accompanied that letter, *Channel Orange,* was not crafted to echo what ended up becoming a major cultural moment.\n\nInstead, Oceanâs studio debut is an unassuming, languid record; its drums shuffle along softly, cushioning Ocean's weightless vocals. Itâs queer, too, in its own pure, nascent way: Across the span of an hour, Ocean slips into different narrative roles, including father, trust-funder, drug addict, Egyptian king, rock star. The act of inhabiting someone you are not is inherent to the queer experience; after all, pretending to be straight is nothing if not the assumption of a persona. Perhaps this informs Oceanâs richly observed characters, especially the subversive closer: On âForrest Gump,â Ocean imagines himself within that movieâs universe, cheering on the well-meaning galoot playing running back. He sings of his fingertips and lips burning as he chain-smokes through his nerves, ending with a lilting outroââForrest green, Forrest blues\u002FIâm remembering you\u002FIf this is love, I know itâs true\u002FI wonât forget youââthat captures the peculiar, melancholic longing of the closet. His tenderness is unforgettable; even the second half of âPyramids,â told from a pimpâs perspective, foregrounds the humanity of the woman who works for him. *Channel Orange*, above all, suggests the work of a profound empath, and in the seven years since its release, Ocean has shown himself to be nothing if not that. âJordan Sargent\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Ffrank-ocean\u002Fchannel-orange){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fchannel-orange\u002F1440760117?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F35181031%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d8902e20480b10008ffa25e]|||\nRCA\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 9.\n## DâAngelo & the Vanguard: *Black Messiah* (2014)\n\n\nAfter he released 2000âs steamy soul classic *Voodoo*, DâAngelo went into freefall, reeling from addiction, a near-fatal car crash, and the deleterious psychological consequences of starring in the thirst-trap video for âUntitled (How Does It Feel).â *Black Messiah* served as evidence that his decade-and-a-half sabbatical also brought about creative maturation. Played by the Vanguard band, the albumâs painstakingly crafted R&B fusion veers from the twitchy groove of âAinât That Easyâ to the Pointer Sisters-ish jazz-bop of âSugah Daddyâ to the delicate guitar balladry of âReally Love.â DâAngeloâs muffled falsetto obscures the lyrics of songs like â1000 Deathsâ and âThe Charade,â but on those tracks, he wades deep into issues like police brutality, putting the album in conversation with Kendrick Lamarâs activist classic *To Pimp a Butterfly* and the eraâs \\#BlackLivesMatter concerns.

Five years after founding her own [label](http:\u002F\u002Fkonichiwarecords.se\u002F) and securing the artistic freedom she never had as a bubblegum-pop teen icon, the Swedish singer [announced](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Fnews\u002F38039-robyn-plans-three-albums-for-2010\u002F) an ambitious plan to release three mini-albums in one year, recording and touring simultaneously to fund her efforts. The gamble paid off: *Body Talk,* the compilation of those releases, distills love, loneliness, and dancefloor euphoria into electro-pop perfection. Its legacy transcends just being a stellar record: *Body Talk* is the mark of a singular artist claiming her future.\n\n*Body Talk* reintroduces Robyn as an innovator and a powerhouse, as well as a woman with complexities to celebrate. Sheâs a hyper-optimized fembot rebelling against societal expectations; sheâs a globetrotting badass you should *know* not to fuck with; sheâs indestructible. These 15 songs surge forward with pulsating four-to-the-floor breakdowns, disco sparkles, and glitchy techno earworms (most produced by Klas Ãhlund). But beneath *Body Talk*âs metallic armor is vulnerability: Robyn is an outsider seeking salvation on the dancefloor, who uses this space to spark the fire inside her. âDonât you know when nothing ever seem to make sense\u002FYou put your dancing shoes on and do it again,â she proclaims on âIn My Eyes.â\n\nA current of self-assuredness runs beneath *Body Talk,* even in its loneliest moments. The recordâs two life-affirming hits, âDancing on My Ownâ and âCall Your Girlfriend,â are vivid portrayals of heartache told from two sides of the same coin. In the former, she is brokenhearted but resilient, dancing her pain away at a nightclub among âstilettos and broken bottles.â In the latter, she is the one crushing hearts as she instructs her lover on how to ditch his girlfriend, imploring him to treat her with the respect and kindness she deserves. Robynâs strength and empathy [inspired](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Ffeatures\u002Fovertones\u002Fdancing-on-my-own-together-capturing-that-robyn-feeling\u002F) a new generation of pop artists, from Carly Rae Jepsen to Perfume Genius, and the escapism her music offers is just as generous: Every song on *Body Talk* is an invitation to transform your own pain into triumph. âQuinn Moreland\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Frobyn\u002Fbody-talk){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fbody-talk\u002F1440714879?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftidal.com%252Fbrowse%252Falbum%252F35613356%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d88eb1d1f868e00096102b6]|||\nXL\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 7.\n## Vampire Weekend: *Modern Vampires of the City* (2013)\n\n\n*[Modern Vampires of the City](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Freviews\u002Falbums\u002F17963-vampire-weekend-modern-vampires-of-the-city\u002F)* was the moment when [Vampire Weekend](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Fartists\u002F5594-vampire-weekend\u002F) stopped knowing everything.

Yet only a handful can claim to have given voice to a movement, as Solange did with *A Seat at the Table.* At once deeply personal and unapologetically political, the album offers an honest reflection on race and identity in America in the twilight of the Obama era. The albumâs rousing message of black empowerment is set forth in no uncertain terms on âF.U.B.U.ââ*For us, this shit is for us*âand feels more urgent than ever as we approach the end of this tumultuous decade.\n\nMore than just rage against the system, though, thereâs a life-affirming joy in *A Seat at the Table*. On tracks like âWearyâ and âDonât Touch My Hair,â Solange rises above the insidious slights that come with moving through the world as a black woman, soaring toward a higher creative and emotional plane. That spiritual levity is buoyed by a series of conversational interludes, soul-bearing monologues from the singerâs friends and family.

Even still, itâs hard to say anyone was prepared for the tempest that is this album. Appleâs fourth record and only release of this decade contains her most incisive, clear-eyed, and ambitiously sparse songs to date. Her smoky, operatic alto is a beacon for roving inner monologues on self-acceptance in the face of sadness and pain, whether offering wholehearted generosity in the face of a breakup on âWerewolfâ or attempting to decelerate the rapid-fire pace of an overactive mind on âEvery Single Night.â Here, she relies on her piano as a powerful duet partner, with winding melodies rambling amid many clattering instruments.

The album itself is a dance between this dichotomy, one black Americans know all too well: between pain and beauty and what happens when one is informed by the other. Lamar invites us to Compton to watch him sermonize from his front porch while jazz, funk, and soul bands rove through, providing the melodies to his experimental beats. With assists from Kamasi Washington, Thundercat, the Isley Brothers, and George Clinton, he shows the range and harmony of black creativity; with his sharp and empathetic lyrics, he gives us the playfulness and joy of âKing Kunta,â the frustration and didacticism of âThe Blacker the Berry,â and the plain hope of âAlright.â\n\nThereâs music made by black people and then thereâs black music: songs that hit you in the chest and make their way into your bloodstream, that become part of you. *TPAB* was released in the spring of 2015, three years after Trayvon Martin was gunned down, and over a year after Michael Brown and Eric Garner were murdered; Lamar knew that pain and knew, too, that more was to come. But with this album, he steeled us against the future and gave us not just anthems but prayers. He gave us the album he knew weâd need to keep going, as we always have. âKara Brown\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fkendrick-lamar\u002Fto-pimp-a-butterfly){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fto-pimp-a-butterfly\u002F1440828886?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F43732748%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d89069e5d366d000838ce6e]|||\nColumbia\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 3.\n## BeyoncÃ©: *BeyoncÃ©* (2013)\n\n\nâWe be all night,â BeyoncÃ© proclaimed on âDrunk in Love,â the most meme-ready track on her self-titled album. She was singing about riding her husbandâs big body like a surfboardt, but she may as well have been referring to the way listeners gulped down *BeyoncÃ©*, which dropped at midnight on a Thursday and seemed to envelop all of social media into the dawn hours while also revolutionizing how albums are conceived and released.\n\nThe first major pop album to adapt to the way we listen to, and watch, music in the YouTube age, her first âvisual albumâ couldnât have worked if it werenât BeyoncÃ© at her absolute best. Over 14 tracks, she peels through her exhaustive musical vocabulary: married-woman trap bangers, â80s-influenced roller-rink jams, grown-ass R&B, burlesque backseat scores, contemporary blues ballads. And then there was âFlawless,â which sampled Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichieâs 2012 [TEDX talk](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.ted.com\u002Ftalks\u002Fchimamanda_ngozi_adichie_we_should_all_be_feminists?language=en) and helped establish BeyoncÃ© as a fierce interpreter and purveyor of black feminist thought for the pop masses.\n\nItâs difficult to understate how enduringly *BeyoncÃ©* shifted culture (âI woke up like this!â), reasserting the artist as a full-spectrum visionary who was also dreaming up the future, invigorating the industry, maturing in her marriage, and blossoming into first-time motherhood.

Born in a period of strife amid self-imposed exile, during a near-mythic island summit of rap superfriends in Hawaii, *MBDTF* is an exercise in God-level debauchery. It is at turns baroque and symphonic, with song-length Auto-Tuned codas, posse-cut performances that redefined the form, and an immense phantasmagoria of light and sound that threatens to overshadow its A-list cameos. It was a creation that accurately reflected Westâs massive ego, in a period of rare bruising: By 2010, heâd drunkenly antagonized Taylor Swift, symbol of All-American sweetness, and been [called a jackass](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.theguardian.com\u002Fworld\u002F2009\u002Fsep\u002F15\u002Fobama-kanye-west-mtv) by a sitting president. But instead of apologizing, Kanye conjured a warped, all-encompassing vision of excess, a toast to the assholes, a battle cry for fellow monsters. It was a huge risk that proved not just redemptive but deifying.\n\n*MBDTF*âs songs are meticulously designed set-pieces that ably house all their drama. West goes bar-for-bar with Raekwon on âGorgeous,â leveling some of his sharpest critiques of race, class, and rap iconography, only moments after pairing beatmaking legends RZA and No I.D. together on an epic deserving of an opera house. The endearing douchebag anthem âRunawayâ stripped Kanye of any remaining pretense, his singing bald and honest, and reintroduced Pusha T as his attack dog. With the industry in flux and rap sales lagging, the new landscape began to take shape in *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasyâs* wake. It spearheaded the first wave of great albums produced this decade; the two biggest rappers of the next generation, Drake and Kendrick Lamar, followed Kanyeâs lead overtly on their breakthrough records. Bon Iverâs profile was exponentially boosted by this album. Pusha and Nicki Minaj arenât really Pusha and Nicki Minaj without it. And for Kanye, *MBDTF* remains the most pristine jewel in a collection of rare artifactsâa perfectionistâs brush with perfection. âSheldon Pearce\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Rough Trade](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984099\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fdecadesalbums2010s\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.roughtrade.com\u002Fus\u002Fkanye-west\u002Fmy-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-b915ce78-8cc9-47a5-b4ff-915ea54f25a1){: rel=nofollow} | [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fmy-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy\u002F1440742903?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F4875681%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d8907371f868e00096102c5]|||\nSelf-released\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n### 1.\n## Frank Ocean: *Blonde* (2016)\n\n\nIn 2016, the hinge year of a grotesque age, Frank Oceanâs cars were his confessional booths. They included a white Ferrari and a BMW X6; the Bugatti âleft some stretch marks on the freeway,â as he [remembers listlessly](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=VHGqsnsuA3c). To Ocean, the car is an Americana icon of certain ideals: freedom that turns solipsistic and reckless; materialism we worship as artistry; barrel-chested masculinity, queered on backroads. Above all, transience.\n\nFrank Ocean is the hinge artist of our time, the true voice of a generation because he takes long silences. With *Blonde* and its attendant works, his *Boys Donât Cry* zine and *Endless*, he took his time building his staircase to somewhere. Elusive and independent, he weaves from genre to genre, sometimes shifting gears to obliterate category altogether, as he cruises past the conventions the culture still fears to let go. On *Blonde*, the languid guitar of surf rock coexists with soft doo-wop melodies; Frank the rapperâwho is heady and occasionally, knowingly vulgarâcoincides with Frank the singer, who is plaintive and longing. Sometimes, he just talks rhythmically, like in âNights.â âFutura Free,â the triptych anchor of *Blonde*, moves from midtempo to atmospheric synth to a clanging guitar solo. The impressionistic lyrics mirror the feeling of wanting to disappear, for a spell: âBreathe till I evaporated\u002FMy whole body see through.â\n\nSongs evaporate on *Blonde*, too: theyâre hazed, minimalist, capricious. The sweet, airy strum of âPink + Whiteâ is hardened by its last few seconds, as we hear birds swarm. So, too, in âIvy,â which starts off a masterpiece of cinematic lovesickness and then warps at its tail-end, ceding to a clang of instruments. The slight touches of distortion on *Blonde* call attention to impermanence, the trap of artifice, and, distantly, death. But Ocean is never sanctimonious; the whole point of existence is that a dark musing on morality canâand shouldâbe interrupted by soft flesh, a sticky plant, a designer shirt. Live a little. Live too much. Because he is a writer first, he kinks his voice to suit his characters and his stories: On his cover of Stevie Wonderâs âClose to You,â a song about the fear of solitude, he multiplies and increases. On âSeigfried,â as he considers settling down for âtwo kids and a swimming pool,â his warble is warm, fragile, and resigned; then he almost shrieks, âIâm not brave\\!â It is an ache, a primal tearing of a social contract each generation learns is a lie.\n\nThe year 2016 crystallized the political disaster right under the surface. People theorized that we needed anthems to get us through the dark night. Big choruses, hooks as wide as highway signs, regular percussion that could gird us from chaos. But our mood was languorous; jingoism was the problem in the first place. We wanted the blurred, the softened, the existential. âInhale, in hell, thereâs heaven,â Ocean sings on âSolo,â capturing the whiplash experience of being young in this country in one line. *Blonde* is one synonym for American. âDoreen St. FÃ©lix\n\n__Listen\u002FBuy:__ [Apple Music](https:\u002F\u002Fgeo.music.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Falbum\u002Fblonde\u002F1146195596?mt=1&app=music&at=1000l32vk&ct=decadesalbums2010s){: rel=nofollow} | [Tidal](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.awin1.com\u002Fcread.php?awinmid=17117&awinaffid=632498&clickref=decadesalbums2010s&p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Flisten.tidal.com%252Falbum%252F65484188%5D%5D){: rel=nofollow}","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"functional-tags":[{"id":"5c8ec8994101df3df85c46b1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"_sensitivecontent","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sensitivecontent"}],"sections":[{"id":"5929d2bfd7a71d1ea569992f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lists & Guides","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lists-and-guides"}]},"channel":"Features","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"592604b17fd06e5349102f34","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"","name":"Pitchfork","socialMedia":[],"title":"Staff"}]},"dek":"The records that made the decade, starring Kendrick Lamar, Grimes, Bon Iver, Solange, Lana Del Rey, and many more","hed":"The 200 Best Albums of the 2010s","galleries":{},"inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2019-12-20T16:39:12.085Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5d9642c3e6ad950008e1c8a1","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1920,"height":960,"format":"PNG","duration":null,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fcn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fpublic\u002Fpitchfork\u002Fproduction\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F03\u002F5d9642c2e6ad950008e1c8a0_PF_Decades_Albums_WIDE.png"},"2:1":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1920,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1920,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":954,"width":1696,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":954,"width":1696,"x":112,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1280,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1280,"x":320,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":960,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":960,"x":480,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"altText":"Solange, Lorde, BeyoncÃ©, and more","credit":"Illustration by [Drew Litowitz](http:\u002F\u002Fdrewlitowitz.com\u002F) and [Arjun Ram Srivatsa](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Farjununcle\u002F).

Producers and artists collaborated through the cloud, mixing styles like potions, from emo trap to EDM ballads to indie R&B to bedroom pop. A million modes of distribution meant you could hear those songs milliseconds after they were born. Artists started releasing music at an unprecedentedly rapid pace. The infinite scroll of social media made listeners insatiable. The result of all this was both a blessing and a curse: There was more great music out there than ever before, but it was nearly impossible to keep up. Here at Pitchfork, we sure tried.

In 2011, good feelings were rare and expensive, but it was possible to get one for free via a sparkling EDM hook. âLevels,â with its monumental synths and jetstream *whooshes*, took that potential and conquered the world with it.\n\nIn hindsight, its sheer scale still feels staggering, but thereâs a sinister undertone to it. Tim Bergling, who took his own life in 2018, at age 28, got his stage name from *Avici*, the hell-like realm in Buddhism where dead sinners are reborn. There is something punishing about âLevels,â which, like the office drone pushing a boulder up a mountain in its [music video](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=_ovdm2yX4MA), seems to climb and climb without actually going anywhere, an illusion of transcendence thatâs actually just plain old limbo. Electronic pop music of the early 2010s, from âHarlem Shakeâ to âTurn Down for What,â was punctuated by images of people in their boring jobs and dumpy apartments exploding into uncontrollable, spasmodic dancingâhalf joyful release, half exorcism. âLevelsâ is the sound of a generation hell-bent on having a good feeling, reality be damned. âEmily Yoshida\n\n__Listen:__ [Avicii, âLevelsâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=_ovdm2yX4MA)\n\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d6fdb022409b8000823ce40]|||\n\\#Merky|||\n\n+++\n\n### 199.\n## Stormzy: âBig for Your Bootsâ (2017)\n\n\nBefore he was a world-famous MC, Stormzy got his start uploading DIY [freestyle videos](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=RqQGUJK7Na4) in which he spit nonstop bars over hard-edged grime beats in streets and parks near his South London home. So it makes sense that the knockout track from his eclectic debut album, *Gang Signs & Prayer*, simply showcases his high-octane rapping and palpable charisma over a jagged instrumental, proving that he deserves to take a seat next to grime greats like Dizzee Rascal and Wiley.

But his actual relationship to such sources could be hard to read: Was Maus poking fun at musicâs power to manufacture an emotional response, like when we find ourselves crying in the middle of a commercial, or celebrating its potential to offer us a fleeting moment of ecstasy, a glimpse of a world that is better than our own? Arriving at the end of 2011âs *We Must Be the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves* with the cathartic finality of perfectly curated exit music, this songâwith its glittering harpsichord arpeggios, briskly pulsing bass, and grandiose allusions to borderless loveâis the closest Maus has ever come to being a true believer. âEmilie Friedlander  \n\n__Listen:__ [John Maus, âBelieverâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=PMku-GbafEg)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d6fdeb99cec850008642de2]|||\nCarpark|||\n\n+++\n\n### 195.\n## Cloud Nothings: âIâm Not Part of Meâ (2014)\n\n\nOut of the glut of lo-fi pop-punkers who emerged at the turn of the decade, Cloud Nothings frontman Dylan Baldi was the only one who got nastier with age.

No wonder âMi Genteâ was such a global, cross-culture sensation.\n\nBalvin worked with William to reinvent the source material, adding Spanish lyrics, chants, and ferocious Latin percussion. His lines like âel mundo nos quiereâ (âthe world wants usâ) transform the song into a universal call to the dancefloor, an embrace of solidarity and unification at a time of enormous worldwide polarization. Aided on the remix by BeyoncÃ©, who audaciously tackles Spanish and ups the diva ante, âMi Genteâ became the first all-Spanish song to reach the top of Spotifyâs Global Top 50 chart.

Itâs fun and clever and anthemic while taking the piss out of big anthems at the same time. Above all the roaring maximalism, Healy is tuned to the sound of his many, many desires: for attention, sex, intellectual validation, intimacy, and, quite possibly, immortality.

Instead, they adopt the playful, nihilistic tone of high cultural gatekeepers, turning it back onto those same gatekeepers over kick snare and hi-hat. So it was deeply satisfying to hear the group strike as strongly as ever after 18 years of downtime on âThe Space Program,â where they chuckle at the idea that NASA is anything more than a segregated train car, meant to take the rich to space and leave everyone else right where weâre at. Over soft-touch keyboards and guitars that pick up where 1996âs *Beats Rhymes and Life* left off, the song opens up *We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service*, Tribeâs final album of tongue-in-cheek musings on the current state of the world and the weekend. âLet's make something happen,â is the mantra, one anybody with a pulse can feel. *We got it from Here...* is fossilized by the passing of Phife Dawg shortly after its release, and this track captures a group, a sound, and a spirit that fought to the last second to exist in a world that remained alien to it. âMatthew Trammell\n\n__Listen:__ [A Tribe Called Quest, âThe Space Programâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=qTrqmNieVKI)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d70098f2409b8000823ce51]|||\nYoung Turks|||\n\n+++\n\n### 176.\n## Sampha: â(No One Knows Me) Like the Pianoâ (2017)\n\n\nWhen it came time for Sampha to write and record his debut album, the UK singer was in mourning. His mother, whom heâd lived with and cared for in London, had died of cancer. The resulting LP, *Process*, is a deeply personal look at the painful and, at times, transformative power of grief, and nowhere is that more apparent than on â(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano.â The ballad finds Sampha anthropomorphizing the piano in his motherâs home, which was purchased by his father, who passed away when Sampha was young. The instrument is likened to a childhood friend who helped him channel his despair into song. As Sampha narrates his coming of age, the hiss of room tone and the cooing of birds can be heard deep in the mix. The effect is one of intimacy, of being welcomed into a private moment of respite. âGabriela Tully Claymore\n\n__Listen:__ [Sampha, â(No One Knows Me) Like the Pianoâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=_NSuIYwBxu4)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d700a0ab349080008010010]|||\nCash Money\u002FYoung Money\u002FRepublic|||\n\n+++\n\n### 175.\n## Nicki Minaj: âCome on a Coneâ (2012)\n\n\nNicki Minaj may have become a star off of sugar-rush pop-rap anthems, but her status as one of the fiercest MCs of the decade was established by tracks like âCome on a Coneâ: punchy, barb-laced polemics displaying crushing levels of pettiness and animus.

But here, DJ Khaled shows his gift for executive production, assembling a showcase for three of hip-hopâs biggest artists. Everyone sounds laid-back and in their zone: Rick Ross leans into the fabulist drug kingpin fantasy he established on *Teflon Don,* and Lil Wayne is at his most casually confident (âYou niggas on the bench like the bus comingâ).

They played slow. They played loud. They made smoking pot sound like an epic journey on par with *Lord of the Rings*. So when the band returned with their first new album in 15 years in 2018, the fact that their gnarly riffs sounded just as inspired as they did in the â90s was worth celebrating.\n\nMetal played at torpid speed often seems to invoke the apocalypse, and a colossal solo from guitarist Matt Pike in âMarijuanautâs Themeâ certainly suggests some kind of destruction.

The lead single from the mega-selling breakup album *21* transformed her into a global star, and she has hardly made anything like it since. The lyrics quickly abandon hell-hath-no-fury clichÃ©: By the pre-chorus, the boiling anger has cooled into sadness, revealing protruding scars. The music follows suitâAdele once described the song as âdark bluesy gospel disco,â which feels like the made-up sub-genre she was born to sing.

The sampled guitars might be from a Modern Baseball song, or maybe another Lil Peep song entirely, and the first voices on the track are a half-buried sample of the California pop-punk band Better Luck Next Time; the echoes run together the same way that incoming headlights smear into one beam when you squint. Produced by Smokeasac, Peepâs closest and most intimate creative partner, the song begins pickled in that signature Peep weariness, but then a second song seems to yawn and wake up inside the first one. This is a cautiously exultant one, a rare Peep anthem of bashful hope instead of despair: âOne more chance, baby give me a kiss\u002FYa got one more chance for a night like this,â he sings.

The songâs intimate verses, cribbed from Clarkâs own text messages to old friends, honor people and places who may have drifted away but will never be completely out-of-mind. âYouâre the only motherfucker in the city who can stand me,â she sings.

Her lyrics ripple with references to liquor and smoke, and the songâs forthright celebration of âgetting faded till we tripâ may well have contributed to it only reaching No. 24 on the Hot 100. (âLive fast, die young, thatâs my choiceâ does sound nihilistic, admittedly.)

He also allowed his protÃ©gÃ©, a young upstart named Popcaan, to bless the track with a verse that includes the line âthe queen fi England haffi love off Yardie,â honoring a Jamaican predilection for the British footwear brand Uptown Yardie that reflects [Jamaican migration to England](https:\u002F\u002Fnewrepublic.com\u002Farticle\u002F149293\u002Fcaribbean-immigrants-transformed-britain-windrush-generation).

But then Katy Bâs remake went Top 5 in the UK, decisively punting out the titular âMan,â and making the young London singer not just the face of underground dance music, but a mirror for dance-pop at large too. Katy is neither a belter nor a cooing soubrette but an everygirl, imbuing her vocals with relatable frankness and yearning. On âKaty on a Mission,â sheâs both a poised singerâher vocal tenses and slacks alongside Bengaâs track effortlesslyâand an audience surrogate.

His booming, Lex Luger-produced warning shot, âHard in da Paint,â contains all of these well-trodden modes while feeling totally singular. At first he brags about having not only a main bitch, but a girlfriend *and* a mistress; by the end heâs admitting, âWhen my little brother died, I said âfuck school.ââ This is not a âdichotomy of manâ thing, where the point is to feel the tension between warring impulses.

Itâs a fitting posture for a ballad about the divine nature of love. On the recording, her voice is sparingly framed with a handful of elementsâa Prince-esque guitar line, gospel organ, and the shimmer of chimesâso when Bey conjures up a primal growl before launching back into a tender falsetto, thereâs little to distract from the sheer force of her vocals.\n\nThe songâs structure is simple: BeyoncÃ© admits that she doesnât know about somethingâbe it math, guns, or warâand then quickly pivots back to her devotion to her partner, finding reassurance in his strength and permanence. The resulting message is one thatâs beautiful in its near-spiritual wisdom: trust in love, and it will anchor and guide you through all of lifeâs uncertainties. âMichelle Kim \n\n__Listen:__ [BeyoncÃ©, â1+1â](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=KaasJ44O5lI)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d702754c64ac00009a14ff4]|||\nNight Slugs|||\n\n+++\n\n### 156.\n## Girl Unit: âWutâ (2010)\n\n\nWhat makes âWutâ such a propulsive blast of energy is both its dexterous manipulation of tension and release, and its seemingly hyperdimensional use of texture.

The beat: a *2 Fast 2 Furious*-style collision of Nina Simoneâs âStrange Fruitâ and TNGHTâs âR U Readyâ thatâs about as tasteful as a 10-car pileup. The vocal: a mangled Auto-Tune yelp about paternity paranoia, cheating, and child support that includes a comparison between serial infidelity and apartheid. The song is about as ugly a piece of music as was made this decade, and yet it was *leeringly* ugly, *purposefully* so.

She lets her imagination run wild as she outlines the course of a hypothetical relationship, jumping from the quiet intimacy of a shared toothbrush to impromptu marriage. âCan I get your number?\u002FCan I get you into bed?â she coyly asks over a celestial synthesizer. âWhen we wake up in the morning\u002FWill you give me lots of head?â\n\nFeaturing a jangly guitar solo and propulsive backing vocals, the song is deliriously catchyâbut with repeated listens, its upbeat surface begins to crack. Is Zauner singing about a new relationship, or is she desperately trying to breathe life into one that has grown stale?

In 2011, Danny Brown was acutely aware of this fact, as he said goodbye to his 20s and made his final push towards rap stardom after spending years trapped in the industry spin cycle. The frantic â30â is imbued with the desperation of a man with his eye on the hourglass, realizing his last best hope is slipping away. What begins as absurdist punchline rap quickly devolves into a catalog of personal chaos. Producer Skywlkrâs horns sound like an accordion, wheezing and deflating cartoonishly, as Brown is terrorized by an alternate future where his lifelong calling goes unrealized. He has visions of ODâing without knowing his daughter, of dying unloved and unfulfilled. âThe last 10 years I been so fucking stressed\u002FTears in my eyes let me get this off my chest\u002FThe thought of no success got a nigga chasing death,â he cries out.

She instantly destroys any remnants of her purity-ring-wearing Hannah Montana image, transforming from Americaâs Sweetheart into Americaâs Nightmare in a matter of minutes. That same day, she releases âWrecking Ball,â the song that ensures sheâll still have a career when the dust settles.\n\nA perfect vehicle for Mileyâs burnt-cigarette voice, âWrecking Ballâ spectacularly captures the agony of losing a love after coming on too strong. Itâs one of the great torch songs of the 21st century, destined to be wailed by the drunk and heartsick at karaoke bars until the end of time. [The video](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=My2FRPA3Gf8), in which a tearful Miley fellates a sledgehammer and gyrates naked on top of a wrecking ball, will likely be used in highlight reels to evoke âthe 2010sâ for decades to come, too.

Opening 2011âs *Eye Contact*, the bandâs nearly 11-and-a-half minute âGlass Jarâ is prelude, overture, and banger all at once. The song is one of their many continuing tributes to late bandmate Nathan Maddox, who was struck by lightning on a Chinatown rooftop in 2002, and a door to the next phase of their career. First comes a slow shift from spoken-word drift to full-on groove; then, synths that rain down with a classical sense of drama. The drums donât coalesce into a steady rhythm until slightly more than halfway through.

Onstage at New York rap station Hot 97âs Summer Jam concert that June, blowhard DJ Peter Rosenberg blasted her frothy hit âStarshipsâ as the antithesis of âreal hip-hop,â adding that it was for âchicks.â It was a small-minded, chauvinist argumentâNickiâs very strength was always about how her wily versatility took rap to unprecedented placesâbut the concurrent success of âBeez in the Trapâ was also a perfect retort. You want âreal hip-hopâ? Here was Nicki flipping bars over an alien beat as thrilling as the rapper herself, filled with synths and drums that buzz and bang and bubble. That âStarshipsâ and âBeez in the Trapâ were from the same album, and hits at the same time, showed precisely who Minaj was: a woman in possession of a strange and singular talent who could appeal to seemingly everyone, from tweens to twinks to rap obsessives. âAlex Frank\n\n__Listen:__ [Nicki Minaj, âBeez in the Trapâ [ft. 2 Chainz]](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=EmZvOhHF85I)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d702f1e13ff690008c6eeef]|||\nOne Little Indian|||\n\n+++\n\n### 149.\n## BjÃ¶rk: âStonemilkerâ (2015)\n\n\nBjÃ¶rk spent the decade increasingly entangled in complex experiments involving VR and bitcoin, with each new album presented as part of a wider technological narrative. It felt quietly ironic, then, that her best song of the era would plug into an emotional well older than time: heartbreak. âStonemilker,â the first track to be taken from BjÃ¶rkâs eighth studio album, *Vulnicura*, was inspired by her separation from artist Matthew Barney, her raw feelings splattered all across the lyrics. âShow me emotional respect,â she demands on the hook, while volcanic beats pound and strings dive around her.

Linkâs rapid delivery, Shy Glizzyâs conversational bars, and Brent Faiyazâs silky throwback melody each feed into each other seamlessly.

Itâs also an exceedingly unlikely Top 10 hit. So many factors worked against âBooâd Upâ: the fact that Ella Mai was largely an unknown; that women in R&B, once the genreâs heart, had become the genreâs outsiders throughout the 2010s; that the songâs languid pace, unassuming sound, and besotten emotional clarity werenât particularly marketable.

Atlanta rappers Gunna and Lil Baby, it seems, just want to make a run of impossibly fun songs and enjoy each otherâs company. Out of their many team-ups, âSold Out Datesâ is the most infectiousâthe one where their voices blend to seamless heights, until itâs unclear where one ends and the other takes over.

These lines about unbelonging also double as a metaphor for the constrictions she faces as a major-label artist who is expected to churn out chart hits but prefers to tweak and deconstruct them instead. Joining the rampage is fellow pop rule-breaker HÃ©loÃ¯se Letissier of Christine and the Queens, who descends into paranoia, posing some truly mystifying questions about whether sheâs âthe smokeâ or âthe sun.â The madness escalates into a breakdown of glitching vocal chops, metallic clanking, and dramatic power-synth fills.

All this matters because âInside Outâ is quite possibly the most lush Spoon song ever written. Built on a rigid rhythm that acts as a backbone for a harp soloânot exactly their signature soundâand frontman Britt Danielâs raspy lyrics about how life can be pretty simple if you know what you want and avoid getting dragged down by everything else, itâs not quite Spoon gone new age, but it also doesnât sound a whole lot like any other Spoon song.

It should feel normal, but it was thrilling to witness a woman governed only by her own rules, acting like a man. On the other hand, âNeeded Meâ is tender and sadly wise, a song about someone who is capable of being strong in a relationship and has learned they canât expect to rely on anyone. And why bother? Put to music with radio heavy-hitters DJ Mustard, Frank Dukes, and Starrah, the song is sexy and savage, a way for Rihanna to flex her unique ability to inhabit the tastes and feelings of both Gen Z and Gen X. It resonated massively but quietly, becoming her longest-charting hit without ever hitting the Top 5. âNaomi Zeichner\n\n__Listen:__ [Rihanna, âNeeded Meâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=wfN4PVaOU5Q)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d711a227cf67c000854d4e7]|||\nXL|||\n\n+++\n\n### 141.\n## Gil Scott-Heron: âNew York Is Killing Meâ (2010)\n\n\nGil Scott-Heron had a love-hate relationship with the city he called home for most of his life. In the mid â70s, not long after President Ford told the city to drop dead, Scott-Heron wrote a love letter simply called âNew York Cityâ extolling the place as beautiful and benignly energetic. Thirty-five years later, when JAY-Z and Alicia Keys were still riding high on their local anthem âEmpire State of Mind,â Scott-Heron presented a different, much darker depiction of the city.\n\nâNew York Is Killing Meâ portrays a place sapped of all promise and opportunity, defined by an alienation and isolation that Scott-Heron suggests is fatal. The production, courtesy of XL Recordings owner Richard Russell, is constricting, as if itâs been breathing exhaust fumes all day. The music is busy yet austere, prodding and cajoling Scott-Heron with jump-rope rhythms, disruptive clatter, and a bassline that pulsates like the jarring rumble of a subway car. âEight million people, and I didnât have a single friend,â he sang, his voice heavy with worry and regret. The past tense hurt when the song was released in 2010, and it only stung more when he [died](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Fnews\u002F42659-gil-scott-heron-rip\u002F) a year later. âStephen Deusner\n\n__Listen:__ [Gil Scott-Heron, âNew York Is Killing Meâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=9aeMfm6O7iQ)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d711b80c64ac00009a150cc]|||\nEar Drummer|||\n\n+++\n\n### 140.\n## Rae Sremmurd: âNo Typeâ (2014)\n\n\nIn 2014, Rae Sremmurd stepped into the spotlight with the infectious âNo Flex Zone,â backed by Mike WiLL Made-It at the height of his superproducer powers. The two baby-faced brothers had a club anthem on their hands, though many were skeptical about their ability as rappers and wrote them off. But within months they topped their first hit with âNo Type,â which elevated Swae Lee and Slim Jxmmi from predicted one-hit wonders into bona fide stars.

In the darkness of a seedy club, these gaudy vices spur RÃ¸nnenfeltâs sloshed barfly to proselytize about his divine privilege. âAfter all I think itâs evident that I am Godâs favorite one\u002FAnd now is the time I should have whatever I desire,â he moans, letting that last word ooze from his lips.

Drake first conceived of it as a remix to DRAMâs â[Cha Cha](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=jzMhcP7ab3k),â with producer Nineteen85 flipping Timmy Thomasâ 1972 soul classic âWhy Can't We Live Togetherâ onto an impossibly catchy syncopated drum sequence. DRAM and Drake bickered over credit as âHotline Blingâ blew up, largely thanks to a music video that cribbed visual artist James Turrellâs 2013 installation âBreathing Lightâ and its Instagram-ready rooms bathed in neon pastel tones. Within months, the high priestess of neo-soul, Erykah Badu, made an entire mixtape riffing on the âhotlineâ concept, expanding it into a treatise on the role of phones in modern society (featuring bars from a Drake soundalike named Aubrey, no less). A veritable human centipede of modern art, the most lasting legacy of âHotline Blingâ may just be the inextricable ties to the work it inspired and was inspired by. âMatthew Ismael Ruiz\n\n__Listen:__ [Drake, âHotline Blingâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=uxpDa-c-4Mc)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d711d03bfe56b000945b796]|||\nGodmode|||\n\n+++\n\n### 137.\n## Yaeji: âDrink Iâm Sippin Onâ (2017)\n\n\nOne of Brooklynâs most exciting young electronic artists began with deliberate secrecy: Yaeji initially sang in Korean because [she didnât want others to understand her](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Ffeatures\u002Frising\u002Fmeet-yaeji-house-musics-most-exciting-new-voice\u002F), then came to love those arch, elegant syllables with new ears. Her breakthrough single is clear in that affection; she roves over narcotic synths and trap drums with icy vocal tones, her gently libertine words delivered in an unhurried rap cadence. A bit of English peeps into the bridgeâmore as an aside than an accommodationâafter sheâs just murmured the line âThatâs not itâ in Korean several times, a lovely and winking moment of benign miscommunication.

His songs, each their own island of brewing affect, are where his ideas find pulse, where theyâre outfitted with all the sensory trademarks that accent his catalog. âTruthâ is the finest, and perhaps most-psalm-like, of the saxophonistâs musical regionsâthe wet bass, the godly orchestral wails, the intoxication and pure-cut adrenaline reminiscent of master architect Phraroah Sanders. Itâs Washingtonâs very own *Odyssey*âonly funkier, Afroâd, and regaled in a Senegalese dashiki. You know, king shit.\n\nOriginally composed for an exhibit at the 2017 Whitney Biennial and later packaged as the closer on Washingtonâs [*Harmony of Difference* EP](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Freviews\u002Falbums\u002Fkamasi-washington-harmony-of-difference-ep\u002F), âTruthâ is about journeys: spiritual, musical, human.

The strategy should be nearly impossible to pull off, and yet the Atlanta star is one of the most gifted stylists in contemporary rap. âMask Off,â his highest-charting single, should be an over-the-top breaking pointâhe repeats the words âmollyâ and âPercocetâ in the chorus more than he does the title. But still he rises to the occasion by plumbing the depths of drug abuse. Future offers his chilling description of lean in two wordsââmy guillotineââwhile a flute sample of âPrison Song,â from the 1978 musical *Selma*, a tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement, snakes around his vocals. âCold chills, prison cells,â the screwed vocals from âPrison Songâ intone at the outro. âMask Offâ is one of Future's most cartoonish songs, but perhaps thatâs the best way to encapsulate a reality thatâs careening dangerously into the unreal. âRoss Scarano\n\n__Listen:__ [Future, âMask Offâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=xvZqHgFz51I)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7120e6c64ac00009a150d0]|||\nMatador|||\n\n+++\n\n### 132.\n## Kurt Vile: âBabyâs Armsâ (2011)\n\n\nâBabyâs Armsâ is the sound of Kurt Vileâs slacker-Zen persona snapping suddenly into focus. The opening track of 2011âs *Smoke Ring for My Halo* felt like a reintroduction for the Philadelphia songwriter, who had previously hidden behind a curtain of reverb. Working with his band the Violators, producer John Agnello, and an expanded cast, Vile replaced the bleary atmosphere of his earliest releases with crystalline finger-picking, and the mumbled aphorisms with odes to his loved one. âBabyâs Armsâ is cool and sweet, intimate and resonant.

The title track from the groupâs 2012 album is their mission in miniature: the sound of ennui in search of bliss. Ruth Radeletâs deceptively blasÃ© vocal performance articulates the craving for novelty lurking within habit: âI drank the water and I felt all right\u002FI took a pill almost every night\u002FIn my mind, I was waiting for change.â The fractured synth stabs are sharp enough to split geodes; the guitars dizzy and sentimental, melty and echoing; the cymbal rattles nonstop.

According to the radio, teen dreams were filled with earth-shattering parties and unconscionable excess tracked to wall-of-sound synth production best suited for football stadiums. And then New Zealandâs 16-year-old Lorde strolled into the charts like a supremely over-it exchange student, singing her chilly, nearly a capella manifesto about just how tired she was of songs about tigers and jet planes and Cadillacs.\n\nWhile âRoyalsââ pillory of rap-video tropes attracted accusations of racism, the song propelled Lorde to stardom and transformed pop in the process. In the years since, the genre has grown bleaker, replacing maximalist odes to excess with bummed-out songs stressing isolation and anxiety. And a new generation of artists who speak to the same sense of teen ennuiâHalsey and Clairo and Billie Eilishâhave proliferated, working to override the industryâs male gaze instead of playing into it.

Hailing from the most anarchic corners of the social internet (but also Atlanta), Carti is someone whose promise will always outpace his official output, and that is by design. âMagnoliaâ is the rare moment when all his significant skills are put to use in the same direction: Itâs a sinister song with an instantly quotable hook that otherwise functions mostly as an extended ad-lib. The hit also served as producer Piâerre Bourneâs national introduction, launching him from relative obscurity to rap productionâs A-list. âMagnoliaâ is the single best distillation of Carti and Piâerreâs chemistry, which, amid rapâs rapidly moving generational drift, has already spawned its own legion of pounding, skeletal imitations. âPaul A.

Spinn and Taso] (2013)\n\n\nFootworkâs relationship to time has a lot to do with a kind of musical sleight-of-hand. Some of the genreâs sonic elements run at triple-time while others dawdle, yet a sense of urgency remains consistent. And no one has ever wielded that energy as fluidly as DJ Rashad. âFeelin,â from 2013âs *Double Cup*, the only album he released before his death the following year, pivots off a languid sax riff from Roy Ayersâ âBrand New Feelingâ and distills soul singer Merry Claytonâs formidable vocal into animated squiggles that ride atop Rashadâs frenzied beat. (Itâs worth noting that members of Rashadâs Teklife crew, DJs Spinn and Taso, joined the producer in fleshing out âFeelinâ from an earlier version he released in 2012.) Ayersâ original is about the transformative power of the first flush of love. Rashadâs take is more a rumination on the everyday search to feel somethingâanythingâamid the frantic pace of life. âRuth Saxelby\n\n__Listen:__ [DJ Rashad, âFeelinâ [ft.

By grafting a fashionably clipped pop melody over a retro, Shabba Ranks-inspired Caribbean fusion beat, producers Skrillex and BloodPop created one of the best tropical house hits of the decade. The ethereal hook, crafted from Justin Bieberâs pitched and manipulated vocal, squares off against a synth horn line and a surging drop. But what truly elevates âSorryâ are its witty lyrics: âI know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice\u002FBy once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times,â Bieber coos, managing to sound pensive, subdued, and even a little sexy at the same time.

The title track to Fleet Foxesâ impressionistic second album revealed a more intriguing side of frontman Robin Pecknold; something dark and complex had lurked beneath the songwriterâs soaring harmonies from the beginning, and âHelplessness Bluesâ represented all of his neuroses writ large. In the verses, he contemplates what it means to be useful, to others and to yourself, before the songâs passionate strumming rips open to reveal miles of wide-open drum fills and dreams of a simpler life in (where else?) the country. âSomeday Iâll be like the man on the screen,â Pecknold claims in the songâs closing seconds. Itâs a line thatâs just ambiguous enough to drive home how frequently his generation has caught a glimpse at a different life and, for a brief moment, pondered the worth of the tools weâve been given. âLarry Fitzmaurice\n\n__Listen:__ [Fleet Foxes, âHelplessness Bluesâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=7HHgedNNQco)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d712b3ac64ac00009a1510e]|||\nEpic|||\n\n+++\n\n### 118.\n## Travis Scott: âSicko Modeâ [ft.

But âSicko Modeâ is fueled by the power of Travis Scott and Drake, two of the eraâs defining rappers, operating at an energized high. The songâs first part is a short Drake verse that cuts off abruptlyâa tease that only makes you want more. Once the funky second beat hits, you forget about Drake as Travis takes center stage with some of the best rapping of his career. The gradual build meets a grand finale, where Travis and the Toronto icon fuse for one of the decadeâs signature back-and-forths. âAlphonse Pierre\n\n__Listen:__ [Travis Scott, âSicko Modeâ [ft.

But by 2010, he was reduced to guesting on anonymous Max Martin and will.i.am tracks, just another pop singer. Then came âClimax,â which single-handedly rescued his critical reputation from lyrics like, âHoney got some boobies like wow, oh wow.â Co-produced by an uncharacteristically restrained Diplo, the 2012 hit was quickly compared to alt-R&B newcomers like James Blake and the Weeknd. But instead of conveying intense feelings with a chilly shrug, Usher is clearly pained as he eulogizes a failing relationship in a lonely falsetto. The verses try to build, donât, try again, donât again. At one point, Usher abruptly turns the whole thing into what seems like a final roaring emotional plea, a would-be climax, but it isnât enough, and the track recedes again. As a match of song to message, itâs brilliant. As a microcosm of Usherâs career, itâs sadly prophetic: He would spend the rest of the decade trying to recapture âClimaxââs highs. âKatherine St. Asaph\n\n__Listen:__ [Usher, âClimaxâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=nNTyfVh3nmU)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d712ca77cf67c000854d52c]|||\nHyperdub|||\n\n+++\n\n### 116.\n## Burial: âKindredâ (2012)\n\n\nAgonizingly, Burial never gave us a proper follow-up to his classic 2007 album *Untrue* this decade, instead resorting to intermittent singles and EPs. But this strategy still resulted in tracks that lived up to the mysterious producerâs lofty legacy, none more so than âKindred.â While still rooted in his lifelong obsession with the feral jungle *choons* of his youth, the song sunk even deeper into the turbidity of our modern world, embracing decay and loss much like William Basinskiâs *The Disintegration Loops* did a decade prior. âKindredâ feels haunted, its errant noises both disrupting the flow and somehow cohering everything into a jaw-dropping, 12-minute opus.

Itâs also the greatest song the Weeknd, that dark knight of R&B, ever made. Ostensibly a druggy party track, itâs called âThe Morningâ as if to dare us to look at the bacchanal in the glare of day, when the abandoned Solo cups are spilled onto the carpet. It was Abel Tesfayeâs first big statement to the world, so resonant it would make him famous: There are strippers and codeine and money atop a hungover tempo that feels like a symbol of generational malaise. âThe Morningâ might even qualify as horror, as Tesfaye refers to himself and his friends as âzombies of the nightââa pretty terrifying way to characterize a bar crawl. The song made the Weeknd an unlikely yet unflinching chronicler of fucked-up times, the man weâll put on the stereo when we want to remember exactly how good and terrible it all felt. âAlex Frank\n\n__Listen:__ [The Weeknd, âThe Morningâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=5TAko3RH0bk)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d71309713ff690008c6ef47]|||\nDaft Life Limited\u002FColumbia|||\n\n+++\n\n### 114.\n## Daft Punk: âGet Luckyâ [ft.

When the full song finally arrived, the instrumentation was pretty much just those four bars over and over, and it was still engrossing. Thatâs the thing about this song: Itâs so simple someone made a chintzy [MIDI](https:\u002F\u002Ffreemidi.org\u002Fdownload3-14492-get-lucky-feat-pharrell-williams-daft-punk) version of it, but so sinuous that itâs also inspired debates by [music-theory journals](http:\u002F\u002Fmtosmt.org\u002Fissues\u002Fmto.17.23.2\u002Fmto.17.23.2.spicer.html) about what key itâs in. Itâs clearly a â70s pastiche, but it also sounds immediate, even before the robo beeps and boops come in.\n\nDaft Punk take the right parts of this song either incredibly seriously or not seriously at all. The disco groove is an immaculate, unironic homage to Nile Rodgersâ Chic, produced alongside the man himself, who plays guitar on the song. The irony is saved for the lyrics, where Pharrell does not even remotely try to keep a straight face while singing his lines about âthe legend of the phoenix.â After four lines, he gives up the philosophizing and focuses on the task at hand: getting lucky. But unlike the other huge disco-funk hit of 2013, âBlurred Lines,â this song doesnât come off *too* sleazyâthere just isnât enough there.

Really, the record was a deeply accomplished inquiry into the possibility of a feminine sound that gravitated towards the grotesque. At its emotional core is âConceptual Romance,â a song that floats like a cloud, its hazy procession tempered by the rigor of Hvalâs lyrics. A self-described love letter to Chris Krausâ 1997 novel *I Love Dick*, which helped shape a generation of feminist artists and intellectuals, âConceptual Romanceâ is about the mind-altering power of infatuation. âMy heartbreak is too sentimental for you,â Hval croons, slyly chipping back at emotionless masculinity.

They may have made their name on rollercoaster hooks fit for Warped Tourâinfluencing the likes of Snail Mail, Princess Nokia, and Lil Uzi Vert in the processâbut here they grew into themselves, anticipating the influence of blown-up Hot Topic emo in the unlikeliest of places. âJenn Pelly\n\n__Listen:__ [Paramore, âAinât It Funâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=EFEmTsfFL5A)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d71355abfe56b000945b79c]|||\nPolo Grounds\u002FRCA|||\n\n+++\n\n### 111.\n## A$AP Ferg: âShabbaâ [ft.

Along with fellow blog-era Columbia signees Passion Pit and MGMT, their off-kilter approach to pop songwriting resonated throughout the music industry; dig through the roster of any major label at the start of this decade and youâd find a few acts who were trying to replicate Caroline Polachek and Patrick Wimberlyâs approach, albeit without the duoâs left-of-center weirdness. âI Belong in Your Armsâ is the crown jewel of their strongest album, 2012âs *Something*. Polachek delivers lyrics as if sheâs gasping for air, spitting stream-of-consciousness non-sequiturs (âBanana split\u002FHonestly\u002FYouâre my remote controllerâ) amid drum machines and synths so perpetually ascendant that they touch the sun.

But Drakeâs message landed like a grown manâs mea culpa for the dog gospel heâs spread for much of the decadeâa twerking devotional to all the Insta queens whoâve been wronged by rudely emotional, blame-denying men like Drake.

Itâs why word-soup rap enjoys a cult following but falls on deaf ears to everyday audiences; âkeep it simpleâ is a motto many lyricists canât hold to. In this way, Kendrick Lamar is an anomaly: As dense as his lyrics can be, he zooms out onto big ideas that are resonant and impactful to the masses.

Its guttural brass line, ferocious breakdown, and vocal sample lifted from Julie McKnightâs 2002 club anthem âHomeâ combine to erect an imposing electronic music monument.

With his inaugural solo mini-album *Rock and Roll Night Club*, the Canadian singer established himself as a weirdo skeez with a shit-eating grinâa guy whose songs showed tons of promise if you pierced through the thick coats of deep-voiced, slow-motion gimmickry. On âOde to Viceroy,â he sings tenderly about his unforgiving tobacco addiction and frequent trips to the bodega to buy another pack. âDonât let me see you cryinâ,â he croons.

DâAngeloâs honeyed coo, âIâm in really love with you,â is disarming in its sincerity and in its faint aberrationââreallyâ is used oddly, as an adjective rather than an adverb. It sounds off at first, but as the strings quiver and the unquantized drums tick along, every instance of the word becomes a knowing wink, a flash of intimacy.\n\nThe song includes a spoken word intro in Spanish, along with violin, viola, contrabass, sitar, multiple guitars, horns, synthsâeven a Curtis Mayfield sample. (It shouldnât be surprising that DâAngelo plays many of these parts.) When âReally Loveâ was released as the single to *Black Messiah* in 2014, its richness felt like a statement: DâAngelo had been largely out of sight for 14 years, but heâd never been idle. âStephen Kearse\n\n__Listen:__ [DâAngelo & the Vanguard, âReally Loveâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=mVsQwJfWzoI)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d71828347318e000977d848]|||\nMatador|||\n\n+++\n\n### 97.\n## Snail Mail: âPristineâ (2018)\n\n\nUplifted by chugging guitars and crashing drums, Snail Mailâs Lindsey Jordan mourns a relationship thatâs crashing to the ground on âPristine.â The young indie rock musician leans into the grandiosity of her pain, layering anguished thought over anguished thought.

In his first two solo albums, he slowed down a George Duke love anthem, sang adoringly about his cat, and composed a heart-wrenching tribute to a late friend. âThem Changes,â from his 2015 EP *The Beyond\u002FWhere the Giants Roam*, pairs this vulnerability with one of his best grooves. Itâs a burbling stomp about being emotionally and literally destroyed, about how his heart has been ripped from his chest and his floor is covered in blood.

In it, Rihanna nonchalantly threatens her accountant with a phrase often wielded by men. In the process, she kidnaps and tortures his wife, before taking a chainsaw to his neck. There are umteen ways to read into the politics of this video: What kind of violence are we sensitized to, and what makes us squirm? What does it look like for a woman to be powerful and angry while also being feminine? How are white women complicit in and benefitting from the bad behavior of white men? But ultimately, determining whether this video is Good and Feminist or Bad and Cancelled is futile; what freedom looks like for any woman cannot be simplified into one set of rules.

More than 40 years later, Alynda Segarra, the singer-songwriter behind Hurray for the Riff Raff, used the poem as fuel for âPaâlante,â the penultimate track from her bandâs 2017 album, *The Navigator*. The record found Segarra staking a new claim to her Puerto Rican identity, after a lifetime of âfinding most of my heroes in white men.â But this song didnât find its ultimate purpose until later that year, when Hurricane Maria arrived. Since the storm hit, Segarra continuously tried to find her way back to her ravaged ancestral homeland in a way that would allow her to give without taking. She finally made it in December 2018.

Written more than 30 years earlier and unsuccessfully retooled for each of the bandâs peak-era masterpieces, the song was squandered at the bottom of the 2001 live album *I Might Be Wrong*. But Yorke never abandoned the studio version, eventually forgoing the experimental synthesizers and Rhodes piano he kept trying to make work in favor of soft piano chords. In its final form, âTrue Love Waitsâ remains obliquely romantic, but instead of begging and pleading with his partner, Yorke sounds resigned to a more solitary fate. In the context of the bandâsâand the songâsâlong-term trajectory, this shift in tone shift feels major: Yorke and co. know that the older you get, the more you realize how little is in your control. âJillian Mapes\n\n__Listen:__ [Radiohead, âTrue Love Waitsâ](https:\u002F\u002Fopen.spotify.com\u002Ftrack\u002F01ZpFhrMMqKPVCwyqXneVp?si=o7xSadIgSzWAqq6rqavMhw)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7808866eee70000829f4b6]|||\nMaybach|||\n\n+++\n\n### 92.\n## Meek Mill: âDreams and Nightmares (Intro)â (2012)\n\n\nWhen posterity whittles an artistâs music career down to a few ripe seconds (and it will), they are lucky to be left with a single drum crack or a yelped ad lib to testify that they once existed.

So he started a band with drummer Dave Prowse and dreamed up a song about teenage abandon, blooming lust, and jumping out of bed to grab a beer with your best friend. âYounger Usâ was written during the sessions for Japandroidsâ breakthrough album, 2009âs *Post-Nothing*, when the duo were essentially making music for themselves. So its manic nostalgia, driven by Kingâs gushing distortion and Prowseâs incessant cymbal crashes, looks backward and forward at the same time: The song doesnât lament lost youth so much as itâs hellbent on recapturing it.

On âLifestyle,â their Auto-Tuned warbles sounded as lush as the manners of living they envisioned in song: Thug bursting at the seams, puffing on clouds from the top of a mountain, Quan reclining with commas in every bank.

At her best, which she is here, Charli XCX cracks a key pop music code: doing as much with as little language as possible.

Today, an R&B vocalist pairing with electronic producers is a familiar idea; during the more wide-eyed summer of 2013, though, Kelela and Kingdomâs mp3 demos sounded like a future the club kids and R&B purists had both intuited, where the black queer underground got its just due as cultural alchemists. Kelela was an easy sell as an underground icon: Her vocals flexed with all the acrobatic skill her generation had learned from Janet, Brandy, and Mariah, while her style whet the palates of the ultramodern Opening Ceremony devotees who run the fashion world. The beats did the rest: The handclaps that drive the track forward are a call-to-action for hips and tongues across genres, from Miami bass to baile-funk to house, drenched in a synth-bed that sounds like a sunrise let-out from a Bed-Stuy afterhours club. âTime goes by really slow,â Kelela sings here, but it feels like it was just yesterday when she was sketching out the sounds of tomorrow. âMatthew Trammell\n\n__Listen:__ [Kelela, âBank Headâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=0q9LcifnTV4)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d793eec4bc6510008699739]|||\n4AD|||\n\n+++\n\n### 83.\n## Deerhunter: âDesire Linesâ (2010)\n\n\nUnlike most of Deerhunterâs catalog, âDesire Linesâ has little to do with frontman Bradford Cox.

On the other end are pencil-sharp female rappers dragging the genre to new edges from behind cat-eye makeup. They aren't concerned with celebrating femininity, or anything else for that matterâthey simply grab for your throat, no matter how you identify. One could argue that a touchstone for both styles was Dej Loafâs âTry Me,â the shimmering street anthem that took 2014 by storm from a Detroit front porch. With her unisex wardrobe, buttersoft voice, and vows to turn her enemies into pasta, she carved out space for female rappers to be sour and sweet while giving dudes some lessons in melody: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, for one, must know he owes his radio-ready flow to Dej Loafâs pioneering style. âMatthew Trammell\n\n__Listen:__ [Dej Loaf, âTry Meâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=3Hn9hLOljJI)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d79407f4bc651000869973b]|||\nDomino|||\n\n+++\n\n### 81.\n## Cass McCombs: âCounty Lineâ (2011)\n\n\nBy the time Cass McCombs released this pillow-soft meditation on the ache of loneliness, heâd already established himself as a slippery figure in American folk-rock, with a penchant for cryptic, out-of-time songs. Casting his feathery falsetto front and center, âCounty Lineâ is the rare McCombs track that sees him fully resisting the urge to obfuscate his best melodic instincts in bizarre chord changes and jarring industrial sounds, opting for a comforting backdrop of ambrosial organ, wispy drums, and twangy guitar licks. Its power resides in the way it offsets all that beauty with the wretched, delicious pain of its subject matter, elevating a highway marker into a metaphor for the invisible boundaries we cross and recoil from as we move in and out of each otherâs lives. And yet, with McCombs, even a lyric as naked as âYou never even tried to love meâ is never straightforwardâto understand why, just look at the âCounty Lineâ [music video](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=sOcnITphyjk), which features footage of a line of cars awaiting passage at the U.S.-Mexico border. âEmilie Friedlander\n\n__Listen:__ [Cass McCombs, âCounty Lineâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=sOcnITphyjk)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d79410e4bc651000869973d]|||\nDomino|||\n\n+++\n\n### 80.\n## Blood Orange: âYouâre Not Good Enoughâ (2013)\n\n\nItâs a cliche for an artist to say that their music is their therapy, but Dev Hynes really does share things in his music that most of us would only say inside patient-doctor confidentiality. âYouâre Not Good Enough,â from his breakthrough as Blood Orange, *Cupid Deluxe*, is not a pleasant thing to say, to sing, or to even *think* while breaking up with someoneâbut why, if its so cruel, does it sound so good? Perhaps itâs Hynesâ Prince-lite funk orchestration and the delicate vocal interplay between him and his then-girlfriend, Samantha Urbani; perhaps itâs how weâve all thought something similar at some point about someone who disappoints us. But even more so, itâs probably the sheer wonder of enjoying an artist whoâs so open that even his darkest ideas become ours.

When you've been gifted with a voice like this, itâd be cruel not to spread it around.\n\nAfter his 2009 breakout âBirthday Sex,â most of Jeremih's singles saddled him with rap features that rarely added much, but âOuiâ was a reminder of how transcendent he could sound when given the chance to carry a track on his own. For four heavenly minutes, the song suspends gravity, accompanying Jeremih with production as weightless as his voice: plinking pianos, gentle swooshes, and helium-infused trap drums that float toward blue sky like a bouquet of heart-shaped balloons.

Yes, heâs there, hobbled by Auto-Tune, a pilgrim in rags ascending the mountain. But the *Life of Pablo* opener is a group effort: an imperiled Kelly Price, an ecstatic Chance the Rapper, a reverential Kirk Franklin, a gale-force choir. *See?* West seems to say. *I know when to shut up.*  \n \nAs uplifting as the songâs message is, the music here is pretty leaden: The trudging drums, the vast silences, the choir struggling against the inertia of it all. But thatâs the songâs power: Instead of capturing triumph or even reprieve, it fixates morbidly on burden. And yet Kanye is there, his friends are there, he fucks up and asks forgiveness, the seasons turn. If West continues to seem sympathetic, itâs in part because no matter how much he achieves, he still manages to make himself look like heâs climbingâsteadily, painfully, an avatar for the possibility that one can be both weak enough to buckle and strong enough to go on. As for whether or not he deserves the redemption heâs asking for, well, if you really believe in God, you know that even assholes deserve to stand in His light. âMike Powell\n\n__Listen:__ [Kanye West, âUltralight Beamâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=6oHdAA3AqnE)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7946fe0db1d10008f1ff0d]|||\n4AD|||\n\n+++\n\n### 76.\n## The National: âBloodbuzz Ohioâ (2010)\n\n\nThe National are very good at making buttoned-up music about weariness and despair, and the time theyâve spent perfecting such downcast moodiness makes their explosive moments hit that much harder. âBloodbuzz Ohio,â from their 2010 album *High Violet*, is one of their finest anthems, a slow-building roar that gathers momentum with every measure. Bryan Devendorfâs drums, halfway between a backbeat and a fill, give the song its relentless forward motion, and his rhythm seems to shove each additional instrument into place and send it on its way by sheer force of will. Singer Matt Berninger offers typically cryptic lines about âowing money to the moneyâ and being carried to Ohio by a swarm of bees, but the true meaning of his words comes from the way he sings themâresigned, a little bewildered, somehow still hopeful in spite of it all. âMark Richardson\n\n__Listen:__ [The National, âBloodbuzz Ohioâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=yfySK7CLEEg)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7947a26eee70000829f669]|||\nPampa|||\n\n+++\n\n### 75.\n## DJ Koze: âPick Upâ (2018)\n\n\nImpervious to trends, DJ Kozeâs specialty is creating warmly funky tracks coated with light psychedelic mist, tracks that braid together yearning, hope, and sadness into a fundamentally human ache. âPick Up,â a towering highlight from his 2018 album *Knock Knock*, condenses his fundamental Koze-ness into six and a half minutes of shimmering disco bliss.

Justin Bieber] (2015)\n\n\nWhat a difference a perfect pop song can make. In the couple of years before Justin Bieberâs âWhere Are Ã Now,â produced by Skrillex and Diplo under their Jack Ã moniker, the baby-faced star was in the middle of an awkward transition from tween-pop hairball to tattoo-covered fuckboi, his countless transgressions splashed across TMZ on what seemed to be an hourly basis. When he wasnât pissing in a mop bucket in the kitchen of a restaurant, he was throwing eggs at his neighborâs house, or visiting the Anne Frank House only to write how he hoped the tragic Holocaust victim âwould have been a belieberâ in the guestbook. For a moment, he was the most hated man-child on Earth.\n\nThen came this song, and everything changed. It started off as an affectingly whiny Bieber demo before the vocals were sent to Diplo and Skrillex, who tweaked and distorted and pitch-shifted them to match their future-pop dreams. âWhere Are Ã Nowâ was released in 2015, when EDMâs trademark drops had all but lost their adrenaline-spiking effectiveness. Sensing this shift, the one time drop-mongers inverted their own style here: Instead of concocting a hands-in-the-air buildup to a blaring hook, Diplo and Skrillex sucked out all of the trackâs air at its peak, like an astronaut suddenly floating in space. The result was discombobulating to the point of deliriousnessâa reimagining of what Justin Bieber could be, and what a Top 10 hit could sound like. âRyan Dombal\n\n__Listen:__ [Jack Ã, âWhere Are Ã Nowâ [ft.

In it, Caribouâs Dan Snaith and a sampled Marvin Gaye sing the titular phrase over a simmering nÃ¼-disco beat that swells into a euphoric banger. But any sweetness inherent to those few words eventually gets smothered by the claustrophobic nature of how theyâre delivered: Itâs about love, for sure, but it also starts to sting as a reflection on obsession and codependency. So by the end of the track, itâs hard to shake the feeling that youâre basking in the rapturous glow of a relationship thatâs become dysfunctionally intertwined. âEvan Minsker\n\n__Listen:__ [Caribou, âCanât Do Without Youâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=BI2Et19vDCM)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7a863e0db1d10008f20007]|||\nYoung Turks|||\n\n+++\n\n### 68.\n## FKA twigs: âTwo Weeksâ (2014)\n\n\nA lot has been made of the sexually explicit lyrical content of âTwo Weeksâ (such as: âMy thighs are apart for when youâre ready to breathe inâ), but less has been said about how much of an orgasm the song is musically. There are all these elongated soundsâslowly arching snares, spilt treacle synths, vocals that stretch into the horizonâthat act as lines of tension, gently bracing themselves for the inevitable. Thereâs even what appears to be a cracked whip just after the one-minute mark. When the drop finally comes (again and again), it carries twigsâ voice off into the abyss. While thereâs plenty to savor in the artistâs clit-sure lyricism, what makes her tale of desire and release a keeper is how its sound embodies the rise and fall of our protagonistâs thirst for her would-be lover; a death and a rebirth, swallowing one another whole. âRuth Saxelby\n\n__Listen:__ [FKA twigs, âTwo Weeksâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=3yDP9MKVhZc)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7a8c718699b30008f1aee5]|||\nMCA Nashville|||\n\n+++\n\n### 67.\n## Kacey Musgraves: âSlow Burnâ (2018)\n\n\nBy picking up on narrative threads of past country rebels, from Loretta Lynnâs sexual frankness to Willie Nelsonâs penchant for mind-expanding flora, Kacey Musgravesâ lyrics have been defiant and open-minded, even when her music has sounded more traditional. But on *Golden Hour*, her third album, itâs the arrangements that catch your attention. Its opening track, âSlow Burn,â begins by evoking sunny Laurel Canyon soft rock as much as it does country, with a serene melody and gently strummed acoustic guitar. But midway, after the introduction of a drumbeat and bassline, it takes on shades of trip-hop, as though filtering Patsy Cline through a Portishead prism. âSlow Burnâ is not so much a genre crossover as an open-ended journey, like the acid trip in the desert that inspired Musgraves to write the song.

But the word âhopelessâ implies a sense of disrepair thatâs hard to face directly, let alone dance to. Yet somehow, it took less than a minute for Rihanna and Calvin Harris to lodge the idea into the radioâs vocabulary with their glittering collaboration âWe Found Love.â While her words gesture toward the worldâs darkest corners, the warmly insistent, lite-house thump suggests starry skies, packed dancefloors, human touch. Like a lot of things concerning Rihanna, âWe Found Loveâ inserted itself into popular culture with idiomatic ease, and the generational gravity of its message only adds to its appeal.

Beatless, ceaseless, the track sounds more like weather than music, a storm from which Anderson canât quite find refuge. The catharsis of âCaliforniaâ isnât so much that the storm passes but that she surrenders to it, and in doing so, gives herself a shot at starting over.   \n \nAs the song reaches its peak, Anderson quotes âCamptown Races,â an old minstrel tune about playing the horses: âI bet my money on the bob-tailed nag\u002FSomebody bet on the bay.â Historically, it was presented as [comedy](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=_tuu5YtkPIo), the story of an enterprising young guy getting ready to try his luck.

Heâd reached hip-hopâs A-list, and âMarch Madnessâ offered a view from the top. Yes, itâs a song about getting fucked up and driving too fast in an expensive car, but itâs also a song where Future reveals that heâs not insulated from the outside world. âAll these cops shootinâ niggas, tragic,â he sang, months after the deaths of Michael Brown and Laquan McDonald. Over ethereal synth arpeggios, digital bells, and 808s, Futureâs vocal acrobatics amplify the tension that plays out in his lyricsâthe highs of luxury butting against the violence thatâs brought upon the unarmed and unprotected. âEvan Minsker\n\n__Listen:__ [Future, âMarch Madnessâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=80eG40_eK7A)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7a8fae256a0a0009483366]|||\nColumbia|||\n\n+++\n\n### 59.\n## David Bowie: âBlackstarâ (2015)\n\n\nâIâm not a pop star,â Bowie insists in this mercurial, nearly 10-minute amble of woodwind jazz bleats, group moans, and tinny vocal shearing. Having reinvented himself so many times, his last musical effort was to bid farewell with that same grace and eternal curiosity. The title track of *Blackstar*, his 25th album, set this tone immediately; its surreal lines about nonchalant executions and bright, heavenly bodiesâbeautiful in their doomed infernosâare sung with comforting humanity, an empathy that overpowers the songâs proggy grandeur.

But on his inventive run of early â10s singles, Miguel posited another way forward. âAdornâ was one of the yearâs few crossover R&B hits that still *felt* like R&B.

Swift tells a big story by freezing time and honing in on small details, the kind that could seem like background noise to others: the scarf that her ex (reportedly, Jake Gyllenhaal) kept as a memento, the refrigerator light that illuminated midnight dance parties. All these hyper-specifics, rigorously chronicled, protect Swiftâs pain so she can tend to it; when she sings, âIt was rare\u002FI was there,â she asserts her own experience against those who would trivialize it. As the song builds, its initially mild-mannered guitar gains energy, cymbals begin to crash, and Swiftâs voice steadily rises. But she doesnât really need volume to convey the magnitude of the damage.

Gangster rap is disparaged; gangsters endure.\n\nThough every detail is in 4K, the screen flickers. Obamaâs promises of hope and change remain unfulfilled; Vinceâs family sticks around, yet so do his gun-toting rivals.

As the song slowly made its way toward ubiquity, eventually peaking at No. 7 in America two years after its initial release, it wooed an EDM audience that was tiring of 12-ton drops and dudes screaming at crowds to put their hands in the air. As a refreshing alternative, Guy and Howard Lawrence created a track bound to an indestructible house beat and filled with the types of chord extensions more commonly found in jazz (or Steely Dan albums) than standard chart fare, allowing for Sam Smith to unleash their jaw-dropping vocals.

Near the end of the song, when Maq yelps, âNow look how far weâve come not listening to you\\!â she cements Camp Copeâs place as a no-bullshit punk band that will be emblazoned on denim jacket patches in perpetuity. âSophie Kemp\n\n__Listen:__ [Camp Cope, âThe Openerâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=40nc_8ij3MI)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7a940a0db1d10008f2000f]|||\nAftermath\u002FInterscope\u002FTop Dawg|||\n\n+++\n\n### 51.\n## Kendrick Lamar: âBitch, Donât Kill My Vibeâ (2012)\n\n\nIn 2012, newfound fame was weighing on Kendrick Lamar. He was surrounded by people he didnât know, while adapting to life as the new voice of Compton. On âBitch, Donât Kill My Vibe,â he took a break from the reflective coming-of-age story he narrated throughout *good kid, m.A.A.d city* to address keeping his musical virtues intact amid so much change. âIâm tryinâ to keep it alive\u002FAnd not compromise the feeling we love,â he rapped. But he also acknowledged, in the songâs lingering opening line, âI am a sinner whoâs probably gonna sin again.â Despite the heavy content, the Sounwave-produced track sounds like a jazzy backseat ride through Cali, with Kendrickâs vocals cycling through nasal-voiced singing, smooth-talk flows, and rapid-fire sprints. He delivered the message that Comptonâand everyone elseâcould put their faith in him.

Itâs about a very particular archetype: the artsy misfit, the daydreamer trapped in a place that stifles creativity and smothers dreams. The character fits into the bandâs past, with its dark anthems about kid-level conspiraciesâbrothers bitten by vampires, secret cities where no cars goâbut this song adds a new urgency. RÃ©gine Chassagne sings her exurban angst with big-hearted wonder, adding nobility to the tired concept of escaping the concrete jungle for more bucolic landscapes, as the rest of the groupâs pearly dance-pop avoids any note of bitterness or pessimism. Listening to âSprawl II,â it feels clear that the songâs heroine got out of whatever grey hell she was in, and found her kind. âStephen Deusner\n\n__Listen:__ [Arcade Fire, âSprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)â](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=awHWColYQ90)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7ba68e0db1d10008f20088]|||\nVP|||\n\n+++\n\n### 49.\n## Gyptian: âHold Yuhâ (2010)\n\n\nEveryone wants a song of the summer, but few people realize the song that defines a summer doesnât necessarily arrive as the season is fully blossoming. There are tracks like âHold Yuhâ that poke their heads Stateside in the spring, before getting played in clubs or on the radio until the melody affixes itself to a moment, then an entire seasonâand maybe even a whole half-decade worth of seasons. Gyptian had been flourishing on the Jamaican dancehall charts for over five years with songs like â[Serious Times](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=dNidyB0KWtU)â before âHold Yuhâ became a crossover success.

All this came to a head in the fall of 2018, when she was mourning both the death of her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller and a broken-off engagement to Pete Davidson. âthank u, nextâ was her response, the polished product of bouncing back from many heartbreaks.\n\nThe song itself works against the somewhat dismissive sentiment of the title: The twinkling chorus is steeped in a kind of corny but joyful gratitude, for the past but also for the present self. Crooning angelically, Grande reminds the masses that we choose to love people for a reason, even if that love is brief. âthank u, nextâ might even be considered a little bit of a troll because of how it challenges the voyeurism of her situation: It would have been salacious to air an ex out for the world to see, but it is more fascinating to draw an eager audience close before offering what is merely a small token of gratitude. âHanif Abdurraqib\n\n__Listen:__ [Ariana Grande, âthank u, nextâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=gl1aHhXnN1k)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7ba7c50db1d10008f2008a]|||\nModular|||\n\n+++\n\n### 47.\n## Tame Impala: âLet It Happenâ (2015)\n\n\nIf you canât understand a damn thing Kevin Parker sings during the bridge of âLet It Happen,â youâre not alone.

It doesnât matter that heâs singing raw syllables, though, because you can feel the wistful acceptance in every note. Itâs the most affecting part of this nearly eight-minute-long song, which opened 2015âs *Currents* and introduced a new era of Tame Impala. No more trivial accusations of retrofetishism or John Lennon idol worship; with this heavy slab of space disco, Parker decidedly broke free of any preconceived notions about his abilities. The riffâa simple, octave-leaping grooveâstands alone, but the punchy drums and elaborate synth arrangements throughout cleared the stage for Tame Impala to claim their place as true psych-rock originals. âNoah Yoo\n\n__Listen:__ [Tame Impala, âLet It Happenâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=-ed6UeDp1ek)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7ba84a53e80c0008f43a81]|||\nRabid\u002FBrille\u002FMute|||\n\n+++\n\n### 46.\n## The Knife: âFull of Fireâ (2013)\n\n\nThereâs an alternate reality in which the Knife never stopped sounding like the sunny electro-pop band who inspired [that one JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez song](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=HxJhYpTIrl8) at the turn of the century, thereby ending up in the third-biggest font size on the Electric Daisy Carnival poster and probably collaborating with Marshmello once or twice.

But her character shows no bitterness for the girlfriend in question. Instead, she gently coaches her lover through breaking up with the other woman, urging him to spare her feelings. The klaxon call of the chorus makes âCall Your Girlfriendâ a dance-pop triumph, one of many Robyn songs to arc toward euphoric release. But the glittery production only deepens the sinister lyrical narrative: âNow itâs gonna be me and you,â Robyn concludes, having successfully manipulated her man into her arms.

Thatâs the mode in which she operates on âThe Louvre,â narrating a whirlwind summer romance thatâs lighting her from within even as sheâs rolling her eyes at the whole thing. As the song begins, she could be working out a sketch in her childhood bedroom, her voice just above a whisper and hung over rumbling, muted chords. An intensely physical connection settles into something deeper, and you can hear her fighting off love until her facade starts to crack. When she drops her guard to embrace love in all of its supernatural glory, it feels as bracing as a dip in a frozen lake. âThe Louvreâ isnât the most readily melodic or explosive song on her 2017 opus *Melodrama*, but itâs the one that best conveys Lordeâs preternatural skills.

While the girlfriend spends the mundane hours of the week with the man, SZAâs character gets to absorb his stress, be in command, and âmake him lose his mindâ on the weekends. SZAâs singing conveys all the euphoria and uncertainty of this arrangement: She presents desire as a transaction between multiple people, singing with the confidence of a person who loves to indulge but who realizes the idea of possession in relationships is slippery. The shades of acceptance, sadness, and hope in her voice, slung over a moody, slow-drip tempo, give âThe Weekendâ its sober dimensionâthereâs a sense that performing the feel-good service of satisfaction is a thankless act, and that she knows she wants more. âClover Hope\n\n__Listen:__ [SZA, âThe Weekendâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=cMD63TwzB1o)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7bae516eee70000829f7e6]|||\nMarathon Artists|||\n\n+++\n\n### 41.\n## Courtney Barnett: âAvant Gardenerâ (2013)\n\n\nThe song that made Courtney Barnett an indie rock star involves a startlingly detailed narrative about the tension of literally being unable to breathe.

Simmering in nervous funk before boiling over into thudding synth-pop, âDance Yrself Cleanâ is a nine-minute jam about Marxism, divorce, and generalized misanthropy that could serve as the collective freak-out moment at a wedding reception. Itâs a stomping, screaming last call of sorts, an invitation to get it all out before the opportunity disappears. âMarc Hogan\n\n__Listen:__ [LCD Soundsystem, âDance Yrself Cleanâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=OoA0cTC228M)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d7bb4e40db1d10008f200c2]|||\nEpic|||\n\n+++\n\n### 32.\n## Fiona Apple: âEvery Single Nightâ (2012)\n\n\nAfter seven years away, Fiona Apple returned to a world that better understood her, and she did it with music that seemed to better understand itself, too. On her fourth album, *The Idler Wheel...*, Fiona charged not just her lyrics but each raw, blistering note with her spirit of defiance, resilience, and fury. âEvery Single Night,â the opener, is a surreal lullaby about constantly fighting with your mind. Fionaâs metaphysical lyrics trace the psychosomatic impact of mental struggle, charting the âbutterflies in my brainâ as they âpercolate the mind,â âtrickle down the spine,â âswarm the belly,â âswell into a blaze.â She has always been an artist aware of her body, but âEvery Single Nightâ feels like a step further. You can hear clenched teeth, whitened knuckles, and a throat about to be shred. Itâs so breathtakingly, quintessentially Fiona: romancing omnipresent internal frictions for three-and-a-half minutes as a method of survival. âI just want to feel everything,â she trills, illuminating the truest theme of all her work: hard-earned aliveness. âJenn Pelly\n\n__Listen:__ [Fiona Apple, âEvery Single Nightâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=bIlLq4BqGdg)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d8239f3a7cd00000919191c]|||\n4AD|||\n\n+++\n\n### 31.\n## Ariel Pinkâs Haunted Graffiti: âRound and Roundâ (2010)\n\n\nIf you squint, Ariel Pinkâs âRound and Roundâ starts to resemble Beckâs âLoser.â Both were generational anthems that made no literal sense, made by inveterate L.A. weirdos who rode the line between sincerity and irony until it seemed to crumble. Both reinvented what was considered âcool,â too. Pinkâs reference points were like no one elseâsâAM radio, commercial jingles, Steely Dan. Countless chillwave, vaporwave, and whatever-else-wave artists followed his lead, but few of them proved capable of the magnificent pop architecture of âRound and Round.â It may be inseparable from its moment, an odd interlude between the peak-indie 2000s and a decade where indie and pop became unashamedly inseparable. But if thereâs any coherent message behind âRound and Round,â itâs that pop songs, trends, and life itself are a constant cycle of death and renewal. âIan Cohen\n\n__Listen:__ [Ariel Pinkâs Haunted Graffiti, âRound and Roundâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=wiLqAu4s-_s)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d823a59d5d1da00099a8e0a]|||\nAtlantic|||\n\n+++\n\n### 30.\n## Cardi B: âBodak Yellowâ (2017)\n\n\nIn early 2017, a few of Cardi Bâs songs had landed well enough to lock in BET Awards nominations and a magazine cover, but she needed more music by summer to take full advantage of those looks. So she went to work and came back with a hit that made thoughtful use of its key elements: action-movie intensity, a proven flow courtesy of Florida rapper Kodak Black, and a bottomless array of bars that were easy to parrot and pre-baked for captions. Like Meek Millâs famously instigating âDreams and Nightmares (Intro),â it got people going; DJs loved it, and influencers did too.\n\nIt was released in June with little initial promotion, while Cardi showed up for cultureâs early adopters, at queer parties and Southern clubs.

Thereâs a road trip to a concert through an unfamiliar countryside, under stars that shyly emerge in a pastel sky. Then the drive exposes a second, inner tale, of a relationship paved with good intentions but now fraught with misgivings and anxieties. With her lover behind the wheel, Newsom addresses some regrets that haunt the romance, namely her own confusion. âHow I said to you, âHoney just open your heartâ\u002FWhen Iâve got trouble even opening a honey jar,â she  chirps apologetically. Nodding to Joni Mitchell, Newsomâs piano arrangement follows the idiosyncratic rhymes of her inner monologue, twisting and turning to the tenor of her puzzled soul. Though she is at her most musically ambitious on this seven-minute opus, the heart of âGood Intentions Paving Co.â is painfully simple: She just wants to be led away from her own indecision. âQuinn Moreland\n\n__Listen:__ [Joanna Newsom, âGood Intentions Paving Co.â](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=KCCl3nzL5PI)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d823b8f4cd79f00091bbacb]|||\nColumbia|||\n\n+++\n\n### 28.\n## BeyoncÃ©: âCountdownâ (2011)\n\n\nIf being in love has a sound, itâs the euphoric vocal run that opens BeyoncÃ©âs âCountdown.â The song quickly gives way to steady snare-drum taps and staccato horn bleats that match the singerâs heartbeat, as she and songwriter The-Dream carefully mix the best sounds across genresâfunk, reggae, dancehall, and R&B (thatâs a Boys II Men sample)âinto one stutter-stepping, ecstatic, instant classic. The premise of âCountdownâ has BeyoncÃ© running down all the ways she loves her man, using a lot of clever wordplay that culminates in a tip-your-head-back, shout-it-in-the-club chorus. At the time, she had been with her husband, JAY-Z, for almost a decade; ever the old soul, she isnât singing about new love, or one-night-stand love, or ephemeral love. This is an effusive ode to her broken-in, ride-or-die, monogamous romance *and* a swaggy reminder of exactly what will happen to him if he ever messes around. âCountdownâ walked so *Lemonade* could enter couples therapy and run. âAllison P.

Now children are reading books about â[rebel girls](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.newstatesman.com\u002Frebel-girls-nasty-badass-women-history-feminist-books-publishing-trend-review),â aka complex women from history smoothed down by cutesy illustrations and aspirational rhetoric. âBad Girlsâ maintains the case for defiance through spikiness: Maya Arulpragasamâs rapping is a blunt and effectively indolent instrument; that clipped, Middle Eastern-inspired synth commands attention like a siren igniting a neighborhood; the S.O.S. signal buried in producer Danjaâs beat needles incessantly about the global imperative for women to defy repressive norms (and\u002For fuck in cars until the windows steam up and the dashboard caves in).\n\nCrucially, âBad Girlsâ is no manifesto. M.I.A. reclaims rebelling without a cause from the white, male cult hero, her trackâs stubborn swagger an incitement to fecklessness.

Where earlier productions contrasted fragility with strength, âCellophaneâ is all transcendent vulnerability.

From the mothership-landing intro to the laser-gun synth pings, you know straight off he has something up his sleeveâyet when he beckons towards the trapdoor, you canât help but follow. *I have what you want*, the elastic bassline promises. *But you need to come a little closer.* To seal the false sense of security, the Norwegian producer layers up familiar ingredientsâa kitschy snare, some fog-machine sighs, a little synth calligraphy, all sounds one might hear in moderation at the IKEA cafÃ©. He preserves the air of cocktail-bar elegance until the last moment, when a distant siren whooshes into the periphery. By then itâs too late. A coil of otherworldly tension, a sensational swing into ecstasy, and weâre plunged into Toddâs magic box.\n\nSome bliss-out tunes adapt easily to your surroundings, scaling down to soundtrack housework or a morning commute. But listening to âInspector Norseâ on a minor occasion feels scandalous, like hanging a Rembrandt in the bathroom. Then again, thatâd be another classic Terje prank.

Even RosalÃ­aâs early fans could hardly have seen it coming: Before âMalamente,â the young Catalan singer was known only for the stripped-down flamenco of her debut album, *Los Ãngeles*, a spine-tingling affair of acoustic guitar and voice. âMalamenteâ seemed to come from a different universe entirely. The songâs age-old flamenco roots were audible in its fluttering handclaps and in RosalÃ­aâs vocal trills, but every other elementâthe lurching beat, luminous keys, hiccupping ad-libs, and samples of breaking glassâwas unmistakably contemporary. The songâs video filled out that hybrid vision by twisting Spanish iconography old and new (Catholic penitents, bullfighters, tattooed truckers) into a dizzying set of images. âMalamenteâ jacked into a heretofore undiscovered matrix of possibilities, and a whole new world flashed into being. âPhilip Sherburne\n\n__Listen:__ [RosalÃ­a, âMalamente (Cap.1: Augurio)â](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Rht7rBHuXW8)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d823e7ba7cd000009191952]|||\nRough Trade|||\n\n+++\n\n### 22.\n## ANOHNI: âDrone Bomb Meâ (2016)\n\n\nThe horror of drone warfare is that it has no constraints. Operated remotely, designed for stealth, and unburdened by national borders or human rights, drones can deliver war at any time, to any place. On âDrone Bomb Me,â ANOHNI channels all that dread and horrible potential by invoking drones as objects of affection. âBlow me from the mountain\u002FAnd into the sea,â she sings with sweet resignation. Itâs a desperate, masochistic request; drones are gods, essentially, and her narrator has chosen to embrace their limitless power.\n\nWhat makes âDrone Bomb Meâ so potent is that this fatalism is not weakness. ANOHNIâs voice is full and resonant even as she solicits a grisly death. Hudson Mohawke and Oneohtrix Point Neverâs production is defiantly colorful despite the grim backdrop: The synths swell and twinkle, the drum programming chitters and slaps. Itâs jarring for such warmth and personality to be invoked in the context of the cold, mechanical nature of drone warfare, and thatâs the point.

Lil Reese] (2012)\n\n\nIn the early 2010s, Chief Keef was a True Religion jeans-wearing teenager whose main concern was escaping house arrest. He released âI Donât Likeâ in an effort to solidify his local Chicago fame, but he ended up stumbling into virality and worldwide renown. With its harsh, gut-wrenching street talk over a Young Chop production that incorporated thudding drums, tinny chimes, and horror-film melodies, the song established drill music as a legitimate hip-hop subgenre. Kanye West would even tap Keef for a remix of the track, which landed on G.O.O.D. Musicâs *Cruel Summer* compilation. At the time, hip-hop didnât know how to respond to this rugged teen; the industry couldnât account for the level of internet and street popularity Keef had achieved.

Painful? Sure. Fun? Sometimes. Weird? If youâre lucky. But embarrassing? Always. This song, written by Blood Orangeâs Dev Hynes, is nominally a breakup song. But when Sky Ferreira sings, âYou know Iâm trying, I was always trying,â she may as well be outlining a thesis on how best to live in the face of daily humiliation. What could be more mortifying than living earnestly in a world determined to make a joke out of everything? Ferreira, an L.A. singer with a husky voice and a [difficult past](https:\u002F\u002Fpitchfork.com\u002Ffeatures\u002Fcover-story\u002Fsky-ferreira-masochism-interview\u002F), has a flair for making the dramatic seem commonplace (and vice versa), especially in contrast with Hynes signature funk-lite guitar strutting.

The songâs arrangement is sparse but stirringâbrushed snare and twangs of electric guitar neither overpower nor dissolve under Callahanâs weighty baritone. At one point, he describes the final exchange between a longing crowd and a reticent performer. âI asked the room if Iâd said enough\u002FNo one really answered,â Callahan deadpans. âThey just said, âDon't go, don't goâ¦ââ A picture of outstretched arms comes into focus, but itâs clear that their reach provides no comfort. Later, he finds himself on a hotel bed, tuned in to a muted television.

But as soon as the track was uploaded to SoundCloud, gloomy lyrics like âPush me to the edge, all my friends are deadâ and âXanny help the painâ went viral; so did Uziâs delivery, which made him sound like a pop-punk prince.

The most familiar version of âVideo Gamesâ is actually the rough mix, a working draft built over live vocals and piano. Itâs not quite polished, and like the grain on a photograph, thatâs part of its charm.

For people who had been listening to the album on repeat during that time, putting on âCranes in the Sky,â its most moving track, was like popping an Emergen-C for a flu we didnât even know we were in danger of contracting.\n\nâCranesâ is a soft-power anthem for frightening times, noncoercive yet still inspiring. Itâs the product of Solange working through the trauma, sadness, and disappointment of being a black woman in this society. Itâs the song you hear when you break through to the other sideâwhen you are stepping firmly into joy and identityâand itâs musically structured to mimic the journey: airy and peaceful and ponderous, sometimes a little bit fragile, but bold in its choices. Thereâs so much space around Solangeâs calm, and the songâs jazzy, soulful rhythms are carefully selected to evoke a whole history of black musicians, black culture, and black spirituality. Itâs notable that Solange never belts, and the climax of âCranesâ isnât a noisy ascension but a quiet one, right at the end: her voice, delicately scaling the mountain to reach Minnie Ripperton heights.\n\nAt a time when power is something loud and dangerous and brash, âCranes in the Skyâ is an atypical song of revolution. It will be played endlessly, hopefully in less toxic timesânot during rallies, or when a candidate walks onstage, but in quiet moments when we need to reflect, recharge, and rediscover our own beauty. âAllison P.

On âYour Best American Girl,â despite how Mitski strives and stretches to fit into the world of her âall-American boy,â it doesnât quite work. The Japanese-American indie rocker feels the pull of her heritage and the traditions her parents raised her with, and must accept they are incompatible with his.\n\n*Puberty 2*, Mitskiâs fourth album, runs deep with such moments of questioning, as she navigates themes of loneliness, depression, and lust. Love isnât the deus ex machina to solve any of them; thatâs the stuff of blonder romantic heroines onscreen. Instead, she offers rougher truths, and none wiser than in this song: Over grandly ringing arena guitars and the kind of distortion that can drown out saner thoughts, Mitski elegantly releases her love, in a sad yet prideful push, valuing herself above tempting conformity. How did her Captain America take this? Did he object? Weâll never know, because his voice and thoughts are not heard. This song is not about his experience. Itâs about hers. âStacey Anderson\n\n__Listen:__ [Mitski, âYour Best American Girlâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=u_hDHm9MD0I)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d88fa0b5d366d000838ce35]|||\nSelf-released|||\n\n+++\n\n### 6.\n## Azealia Banks: â212â (2011)\n\n\nâ212â launched the force that is Azealia Banks by way of the sweet-voiced theater nerdâs sneer of, âIâma ruin you, cunt.â Itâs a ratatat MC in the Harlem tradition, twisting her claymation cadences around a frothy house beat. Itâs a New Yorkerâs goodbye to New York, an overdue starâs coming-out party, and a warning to herself. (It was also a YouTube smash before the industry knew what to do with those.) Flipping a previously obscure Belgian dance track, Azealia Banks was one of the decadeâs first to recognize that the sound of vogue culture would reverberate far beyond the city. Celebrated French-Canadian producers Lunice and Jacques Greene make cameos in the unforgettable black-and-white video, but only cameos: â212â felt like pure Banks, the unfiltered arrival of a fiery new voice.

They told the story of his first loveâa manâand that nameless summer longing that whistles through us all. He kept his thoughts private for awhile, and instead posted a cryptic message on his Tumblr: âfuck. that was hard to write.â When he did publish his writing, an open letter, it was on July 4th the following year, still three years before the U.S. Supreme Court would strike down the ban on same-sex marriage, but just days before he surprise-released his official debut, *Channel Orange*. âI feel like a free man,â Ocean concluded in the letter. âIf I listen closely.. I can hear the sky falling, too.â What an unprecedented act of bravery in the history of black music, of queer music, of all music; he opened the door so that we could at once pour ourselves into his light. It was the lens through which we listened to *Channel Orange*, and no song echoes the love, the glow, the tectonic impact of Frank Ocean more than âThinkin Bout You.â\n\nCall it R&B, or nÃ¼-doo-wop, or the music from the guy in Odd Future who sings, whatever you want, âThinkin Bout Youâ belongs in a delirious world of its own. The songâs direct address is shaded with nostalgia and fabulism, its vision so wide it takes cues from â70s songwriter [Albert Hammond](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Gmq4WIjQxp0), Princeâs *Sign âOâ the Times,* and country legend [George Strait](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=ioPa1URjZ_Y). Every single moment, from the tornado to Southern California to the beach house in Idaho, feels like Ocean is flying at the ceiling unlimited: when the snare eighth-notes lock-in with Oceanâs vocals, when he leaps out of nowhere to the falsetto in the chorus, when he sings, âYes, of course I remember\u002FHow could I forget how you feel?â For Ocean, itâs a foregone conclusionâ*yes, of course*âthat those endless days and nights feeling that ânew feelâ will last forever. We all have that one summer, that one love that altered the course of our lives. This was Frank Oceanâs, and he graciously let it be ours, too. âJeremy D.

The tension of the song was immediate from the siren of Mike WiLLâs hypnotic two-note opening: It felt viscerally reactive to the moment, a response to the murder of black people at the hands of the police, a reminderâvia the opening voice of Messy Mya from beyond the graveâthat the cyclical nature of violence is heightened among communities forgotten by the government. It reminded me of the story behind Nina Simoneâs âMississippi Goddamn,â a furious song Simone wrote in 1964 as an antidote to internal anger, delivered with the pep of a show tune, that reflected on the murder of civil rights activist Medgar Evers and a white-supremacist attack on an Alabama church that killed four young girls. Simone once said, âWe will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore.â When BeyoncÃ© performed âFormationâ at the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show, the day after its release, wearing the bandoliers of the Black Panthers, it felt like she was ready to take the reins and be seen doing so.\n\nIn the unforgettable video, BeyoncÃ© crouches on a cop car submerged alongside houses in New Orleans devastated by natural disaster, the scene interspersed with images of people dancing in the darkâitâs the no-fucks vibrancy of a culture that persists when the systems surrounding them have been sucked into the muck and left to languish. BeyoncÃ© celebrates the Southern black vernacular and Southern black culture: marching bands, cowboys, step squads, Mardi Gras, and bounce queens appear in the video, and in the song, she flaunts her âbaby hair and afrosâ and her ânegro nose with Jackson Five nostrils.â\n\nThough the song was thoroughly and specifically for and about black women and their unseen labor, the whole world was quick to rally behind another Bey hit. Hillary Clinton, hot on the campaign trail, would mention she had hot sauce in her bag on an interview with long-running hip-hop radio show, âThe Breakfast Club,â Etsy would commodify her language and iconography, so that women of every race could get in formation. The next year, âFormationâ would lose two Grammys to Adeleâs âHello,â but the phrase âOK ladies, now letâs get in formationâ would appear across signs at the Womenâs March and in allyship alongside the \\#MeToo movement, reinvigorated from a decadeâs existence by the Weinstein allegations. The songâs initial appeal was an awakening for a country in crisis. But it will live on as a reminder of the slow, persistent, daily work of organizing and the power of resilience and protestâthe importance of holding grief, anger, hope, and pride side by side. âPuja Patel\n\n__Listen:__ [BeyoncÃ©, âFormationâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=WDZJPJV__bQ)\n\n* * *\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5d88fb960480b10008ffa259]|||\nInterscope\u002FKonichiwa|||\n\n+++\n\n### 3.\n## Robyn: âDancing on My Ownâ (2010)\n\n\nNew York Cityâs subway system is typically associated with maddening delays, twitchy vermin, and, occasionally, [traces of the bubonic plague](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.thedailybeast.com\u002Fcheats\u002F2015\u002F02\u002F06\u002Fbubonic-plague-germs-found-in-nyc-subway). It is a place where you strap on headphones like armor and try to block out humanity. But everything changed for a few minutes on the night of March 8, 2019.

Such is the power of âDancing on My Own.â\n\nA month after that impromptu party, the bubbling anthem, which first hit the internet in the spring of 2010, was finally certified platinum in Americaâcosmic justice for a song that never touched the *Billboard* Hot 100 but still served as a lodestar for so much of this decadeâs pop. With âDancing on My Own,â from her defining album *Body Talk,* Robyn took the euphoric ache of classic house and disco, spiked it with her own obsessive brand of vulnerability, and set a blueprint for everyone from [Lorde](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=xguIYNjYU1A) to [St. Vincent](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=dNm0b2SCXxY) to [Taylor Swift](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=RvYysauPsMc) to worshipfully follow.   \n \nAt its core, the song is an exploration of contradictions: between the mechanized backbeat and Robynâs all-too-human vocals; between a dancefloorâs collective catharsis and the isolation of being trapped inside your own skin; between the despair of the heart and the resilience of the body. âIâm right over here, why canât you see me?â Robyn pleads to an oblivious ex making out with someone new across the club.

Fighting is the only way we know forward.\n\nThe centerpiece of Kendrickâs most ambitious opus, *To Pimp a Butterfly*, âAlrightâ permeated the collective consciousness in the spring and summer of 2015. It was around the time people became tragically familiar with names like Freddie Gray and Sandra Bland, and when nine black people were shot and killed inside of a historic church in Charleston, South Carolina. As a cornerstone of the \\#BlackLivesMatter canon, the song seemed like a beacon of light ushering us away from terror. You could argue that things are worse now than they were then, that its hope was misplaced. But âAlrightâ isnât promising a better world, just that weâll find a way to survive the one we have. It is a defense mechanism, pining for an aspirational futureâmaybe even a nonexistent oneâas it helps us cope with our chaotic present.\n\nFor the entire 2010s, from *Section.80*âs survivalist stories of the post-Reagan hood to *good kid, m.A.A.d. city*âs autobiographical cinema on the futile fight to escape the quicksand of street life, Kendrickâs work has often dealt with persisting under perilous circumstances. *To Pimp a Butterfly* considers oppressionâs sprawling impact, from colorism to survivorâs guilt, longing for a way we could all make it out together. To that end, âAlrightâ serves as a thesis statement of sorts: that the path through lifeâs trials begins with striving for more, for better. You can imagine the characters who cycle in and out of his songs whispering â*We gonâ be alright*â to themselves, or reassuring loved ones between sighs, trying to make it through the next day. Here, as horns wail and drums snap, there is a sense that the âweâ is actually unfathomable, a force that can overcome anything when banded as one. âSheldon Pearce\n\n__Listen:__ [Kendrick Lamar, âAlrightâ](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY)","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"functional-tags":[{"id":"5c8ec8994101df3df85c46b1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"_sensitivecontent","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sensitivecontent"}],"sections":[{"id":"5929d2bfd7a71d1ea569992f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lists & Guides","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lists-and-guides"}]},"channel":"Features","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"592604b17fd06e5349102f34","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"","name":"Pitchfork","socialMedia":[],"title":"Staff"}]},"dek":"The defining tracks of the decade, starring Robyn, Drake, Vampire Weekend, Daft Punk, SZA, and many more","hed":"The 200 Best Songs of the 2010s","galleries":{},"inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2019-10-21T15:39:51.947Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5d961c37e6ad950008e1c89c","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1920,"height":960,"format":"PNG","duration":null,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fcn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fpublic\u002Fpitchfork\u002Fproduction\u002F2019\u002F10\u002F03\u002F5d961c37e6ad950008e1c89b_PF_Decades_Songs_WIDE%20(1).png"},"2:1":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1920,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1920,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":954,"width":1696,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":954,"width":1696,"x":112,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1280,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1280,"x":320,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":960,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":960,"x":480,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"altText":"Grimes, Mitski, Jai Paul, and more","credit":"Illustration by Drew Litowitz and Arjun Ram Srivatsa.
